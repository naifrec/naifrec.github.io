I work as Machine Learning Researcher at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam. My research interests lie at the crossroads of generative modeling, source compression and information theory. See my [publications](/publications/) on these topics.

I co-founded [All We Need Is Acid](https://www.facebook.com/allweneedisacid), a non-profit organisation focused on electronic music. We have an array of activities: organizing parties in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, a [radio show](https://www.radiopanik.org/emissions/all-we-need-is-acid/) on Radio Panik 105.4 in Brussels, a [monthly podcast](https://soundcloud.com/allweneedisacid/sets/podcasts-awnia) showcasing upcoming artists and friends, and more.

In my blog I intend to share my notes and thoughts on music, video games, and other hobbies of mine.
