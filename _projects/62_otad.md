Third day in a row where my pick of the day is something that also came by mail to my house! Today I received my order from [Worst Records](https://worst-records.bandcamp.com/), which I most recently discussed when showcasing [A Strange Wedding’s last entry on the label, Black Magic Rituals](/music/53_otad/). While I of course bought this record, I also tried to hedge the delivery fee by bundling more records with it, and it was not a hard thing to do given Worst Records incredible catalog. So... lo and behold! Ombre by Tambrui Neri and Hiroko.

The album, with its mystical incantations and entrancing rhythms, suits particularly well as follow-up release to Black Magic Rituals. The selected track, Giochi d’Ombre, relies on a powerful chant to bewitch the listener, bringing them to ever higher states of consciousness, to finally release all the momentum into a decisively slow trance, almost EBM-like end part. Mighty stuff, perfectly introducing [the next track Ama](https://worst-records.bandcamp.com/track/ama).

Hard not to mention the brilliant covert art, where a serpent deity with a red sun shining like an eye in the sky seem to be guarding an interdimensional game of chess. The color palette is subtly simple, and vividly so! Glad to decorate my home with this masterpiece... I could frame the sleeve and already be a happy man!

Hope you enjoy this LP, don’t sleep on the rest of the tracks. An entrancing home listening experience awaits. Peace out.
