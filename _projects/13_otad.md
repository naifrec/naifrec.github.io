In August 2016 we were celebrating the 25th birthday of two of our best mates, Merlet and Philippe. The party was hosted in the backyard (and I should probably say field) of Philippe’s house, deep in the countryside of Bretagne, near Concarneau. The weather was amazing, the summer warmth, the cloudless skies. I had brought my controller, the amazing Native Instruments Kontrol S4 MKI-I I had bought second-hand to some dude in Liverpool. They had rented to some of their free-party friends one of the loudest sound system I ever played on.

I feel like our entire group of friends from engineering school was there, and if one thing unites us, it’s partying. Back in those days, I was living with two of my mates in Paris, Merlet and Flo. With these guys we were constantly listening to old school techno classics, from [Laurent Garnier - Acid Eiffel](https://youtu.be/VO_PAy3x5UU) to [Jaydee - Plastic Dreams](https://youtu.be/UwPKi1H8t9M). So I spent my set playing acid tracks from the 90’s, we played through the night. And I remember a particular moment, a particular track, a true piece of life, seconds I live for.

This old school techno / trance track from the amazing producer Microwave Prince had us shutting up, concentrating on dancing, spiralling up, a spiritual bridge to sentience. Love to all my raver friends out there, enjoy!
