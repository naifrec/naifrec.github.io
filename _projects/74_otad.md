I know this is quite a repeat [from yesterday’s article](/music/73_otad/), but it is hard for me to ignore that I have been playing on repeat Twice A Man *“Launch Music 2004”* album for the entire day. All tracks (but the last maybe) flow so well, very easy listening downtempo / trance inspired electronic music.

I am happy I took the time to upload it to YouTube, as I am sure it will allow some to enjoy quite the hidden gem. My favorite track is probably the fourth one, *Ergonomics*. Some might say it sounds like elevator music... I could potentially agree with the elevating part. It’s just an overall chill track, almost lounge, not a worry in the world kind of vibe. I find it very relaxing, and somewhat enchanting as it does not really go anywhere either.

The third track, *Design*, is the closest to [their *Kula World* entry](https://youtu.be/zueljQBAEgg), with clearly trancey parts, as for instance the infamous piano of trance house of the 90’s. This one has more tension to it, dreadful chords, it really feels like a 4th bonus level track for *Kula World*. I definitely dig the somewhat oriental vibes during the break at 09:50, which throws me back to *[Hiro](https://youtu.be/FgJMGsig634)*.

I hope you find yourself entranced by this album too, as for myself it took a few listening sessions to appreciate it at its full potential.
