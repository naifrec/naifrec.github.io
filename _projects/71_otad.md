I read a tweet a few minutes ago which simply said: *“fyi things will not slow down next week”*. And it hit me harder than it should have. There is so much truth to it. I sometimes wonder if I am evaluating the importance of certain things right. Am I spending enough time with my loved ones? Am I focusing on the right things in life? While I can almost confidently answer that I think my work project has a deeper meaning, a broader impact which I can get behind, all of the other choices, the personal ones, the ones we are least trained for, I am always so anxious about them. When is the right time for anything, [have I missed the starting gun?](https://naifrec.github.io/music/70_otad/) My mother and I have the bad tendency of postponing difficult choices until we are our backs to the wall, living in angst all the while. I wish sometimes I would either take the bull by the horns and be confident about where I am going, or someone would come and do it all for me.

I tried to find a track which could calm my nerves, something droning and calming. I turned to my dodo techno playlist, [a playlist name I stole from Romain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfB5RuF-Lk4&list=PLR-O8bbwDfOckK7fOg8Y4ReIMWdBjBxGi). This playlist never disappoints, it is one we curated with much care for years on end. My pick from it today is a track from Aleks, remixed by Kiyadama.

This track is a slow burner, with an acid line bouncing back and forth in an elastic elliptoid, nonchalantly dragging you in the zone. The deep ambient pads will pin you in this stasis and make you forget about the existence of time. A simple recipe yet masterfully executed, an ambient techno track like I love them. A comfortable nest for my thoughts. Hope life is treating you well, peace out.
