Everything should have made me follow [Brothers From Different Mothers](https://bfdm.bandcamp.com/) earlier. As early as 2014, I saw [J-Zbel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk7ylGqz2UY) at the festival Les Nuits Sonores in Lyon, I remember some incredible performance where 3 dudes were bumping some really dope tracks, with their bandana, spitting fire tracks like they be throwing molotov cocktails in the crowd! Both my friends DJ Antoinette and Waveguide kept repeating me to start digging through their catalog. In the end it’s a party in Garage Noord, end of 2019, that truly made me fall in love with them. The entire crew was showcasing the label’s work, and hot damn this party was bumping so hard I (genuinely) hurt my knee. They were doing this crazy back and forth between trap at around 80/90BPM and hardcore i.e. the perfect double of that. Some beats to overthrow the patriarchy to.

Only recently did I decide to go through their catalog, and as I opened their bandcamp page, my eye got inevitably caught by a very appealing name: [Simo Cell](https://youtu.be/mgclIjf04tY). This guy is no short of amazing, true product of the Bristol scene (yet French), with crazy productions, always so different yet so perfectly timeless. I heard legends of his B2B with Lowjack when closing Berlin Atonal each year, and damn I regret never having been there just for this reason.

His latest release on BDFM is what happens if you mix UK’s bass music with arab vocals. My favorite track, Pending in Pattern, is on repeat since I discovered it yesterday. Because BDFM’s description of the work cannot be topped, I will simply quote it:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
    The result goes way beyond expectations, pushing forth a uniquely free, mind-expanding brand of sufi-esque riddims and more ambientoid spaces for contemplation as it steers clear from normative club music to root deeper into socio-politically charged instrospection and thoughtful, elegiac body music.

Hope you enjoyed the track! See you tomorrow for ambient Sunday.
