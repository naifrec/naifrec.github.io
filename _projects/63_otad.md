Sunday again, ambient it is! I do not have a lot of time to describe my track of the day, so today will be a short post, but significant nonetheless as it introduces one of my favorite drone artists: Oophoï.

This 30 minutes long track has stayed buried within me since the first day I listened to it. Deeply magical, almost transcendental, it rings like a rite of passage to another world of light and wisdom. The overwhelming bird chirping sounds, the low hertzian humming synth droning in the background, the occasional distant singing… the whole is so intimately nostalgic. It is one of my first drone discoveries back in 2015, and I have been religiously listening to it at least once a month since then.

I sincerely hope you dig it as much as I do, it’s not a track to focus to though; like many ambient works, it is best experienced when lying down or trying to work out a problem. Peace out.
