    The Sentinel (aka Photek) - Toulepleu (1996)

My first encounter with ambient drum and bass was accidental, [through one of Moomin’s releases](/music/3_otad/). I did not dig much deeper until YouTube autoplay started surfing that vibe one day, and threw my recommendations into the Photek blackhole. One of the first to come up was this track he released as “The Sentinel” way back in 1996.

Photek offers here a super lush track, probably the lushest of all. Ethereal chords dance around as a drums shake, fading in and out until the deepest of bassline drops, 50Hz wobbles to test your subwoofer. Then comes the pinnacle of the track, the cheesy yet perfect voice track… Everything just clicks together so splendidly. 10/10 track; released on a landmark label for the genre, Basement Records, recommend digging through! Enjoy.
