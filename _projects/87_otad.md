Today I went back to one of the few albums which work as blackholes on me, hard to escape their gravity field and find myself listening to them again and again, sometimes at the detriment of looking for new music. I had teased waaaay back in [our ambient sunday on Vladislav Delay - Entain](https://naifrec.github.io/music/28_otad/) (another blackhole...) that he had music under a different moniker, Luomo. I present to you his first album under this name: Vocalcity, released in 2000 on Force Tracks.

Listening to Vocalcity for the first time was a true slap in the face. It is like I had discovered music again. Incredibly, even though I had already listened to Entain 10 million times by then, I was dazed by the production on this album. Every groove seems to emerge from random patterns thrown together, with a class... absolutely immaculate, impeccable, sharp. This album is crispy with an accent on the “p”. For me I truly start jiving with it on the second track, rightfully named “class”. From there it’s like the album just flows and flows, to the point where it’s hard to latch on the track’s delimitations. It just feels like one continuous stream of consciousness thrown at you telepathically, like some kind of alien sharing what house music sounds like on his faraway planet.

To me this album is the true work of a genius... did these grooves form spontaneously out of experimentation or did some ancient god communicate to him arcane secrets on rhythms and sounds? I guess we'll never really know... *[X-files music plays](https://youtu.be/9LLuoD1YQSw)*. Needless to say I would feel personally offended if you would not go out right now and listen to this album from start to finish, so please either click [here](https://open.spotify.com/album/0SYQ4x4DsodUOdJcWYmM5V?si=RslRpHmVQkCUMz-j9ByhZw) or [here](https://youtu.be/GIiqldGMv34) and fulfill your duty. I have my minions ready to report, be careful.
