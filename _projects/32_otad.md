Today I would like to introduce you to one of my favorite Parisian crews, [D.KO records](https://dkorecords.bandcamp.com/). Some of the artists on the label you may know are Mézigue, [Paul Cut](https://youtu.be/l7A5u0FO9RA), [Mad Rey](https://youtu.be/3gSLwjy28HM) and Flabaire, and there were also few appearances of [Leo Pol](https://youtu.be/6KQuNU6Ykfw)! Mézigue, who introduced me to D.KO, made his name by releasing anthem house tracks, which were usually accompanied with amazing video clips.

The track I selected today is from a release that seemingly went a bit more under the radar, [Bandwidth by Flabaire](https://dkorecords.bandcamp.com/album/flabaire-bandwidth-d-kolp04). I intentionally selected one of their more quiet records, as it best exemplifies the breadth of reach of the label, which does not purely focus on party music. I randomly stumbled upon the record at Rush Hour Records in Amsterdam back in 2018. It is a LP, and it shows, clearly more attuned for home-listening, with ambient and dub tracks all around.

AP/PM is quite special, it throws me some [Dub Taylor - Detect vibes](/music/26_otad/). It starts off with some small, glitchy sounds. A filtered triple kick starts, detuned chords weave left to right. Bassline starts, pretty minimal too. Things start to groove, a fat kick enters the chat. More high pitch percussion comes to finetune the flow, and finally come the chopped dubby chords. Yes, I would not have guessed it from this intro; but we are definitely into some dub tech flavored track.

Another track I highly recommend from this album is The Royal Scam. A truly beautiful ambient piece, with echoey guitar riffs flying in squadrons with some deep ambient pads. A marvel of a piece taking a nice and slow 12 minutes to unravel. Miam. Enjoy!
