Today is a special day, it’s Romain’s birthday. 31 and counting! I went to his in the evening to celebrate this together, brought a bottle of champagne but most importantly his gift (which incidentally is my pick of today): two LPs from Tommy Guerrero, Soul Food Taqueria (2002) and Road to Knowhere (2018). And yes, we are talking about [this Tommy Guerrero](https://youtu.be/S-dyZiumKkU), the same dude who pioneered street skateboarding apparently had a prolific music career, with close to 12 solo albums and countless appearances.

As a review on bandcamp describes, Tommy’s music is that of a *modern Santana with hip-hop/soul/funk influences*. The track I selected coincidentally also appears as the title track in the video game Tony Hawk: American Wasteland (2005); one of the last good Tony Hawk games, [all known for their amazing OSTs](https://naifrec.github.io/music/57_otad/).

The entire album is worth a spin, with super relaxed vibes, summer afternoon chilling at the park kind of vibes. I always have difficulties finding good albums for these moments as I tend to listen to either way too chill (ambient) or way too fast (breaks, dnb) music. Even the downtempo tracks I have are usually too party-oriented. This in contrast hits the perfect balance. Cannot wait to chill at Romain’s this summer; this album playing in the background, sipping on a cold beer, my feet in his lil’ water pool discussing the latest party.

Happy birthday again to the master of cool Romain, peace out!
