It’s Friday, I hesitated to try and find a good party track, but my mood is more melancholic today after a long week of work. I hence turned to my ambient techno playlist, a playlist once flourishing which I unfortunately do not entertain as much nowadays. The entries there become more rare, yet perhaps more significant. One of the last entries is actually a track I discovered way back in 2015, back when I was super into Vril (and [Giegling in general](https://youtu.be/0McBUeu0FUU)).

Anybody partying in 2014/15 would have heard this track countless times, the official closing track of most parties I went to in Paris at that time. You can probably understand why at the time, I went desperately looking for more stuff from him. And by digging deep, I came across an alias rarely sighted on Giegling Records:  Zum Goldenen Schwarm. Only track released under that name was on a record by Vril himself in 2012; which makes me suspect it’s one of his undisclosed aliases. Intrigued, I took a peek at this newly released album called Aufgang, and manne...

This album is a true work of art, a deep ambient / dub techno, slow burner. I shared here the last track, by far my favorite, taking the entire D side on the vinyl release, one item from my collection I cherish dearly. The atmosphere is hard for me to describe, or let’s say I cannot top this YouTube comment from Lukasz Gazda:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
    12:17 to 15:02 - never heard nor felt anything like this before during my journey with electronic music. It's like an interstellar signal, a sound wave sent to me from the gods above to visit another dimension.  Indescribably intriguing in its design, mysterious and even shocking in some way, talking about the whole composition. So powerful and alien, yet so beautifully humane and calming at the same time. Not just a listen, it's an experience.

Pour yourself a nice brew, sit in a comfortable chair, turn on your hifi system, seat back and relax. Hope you have a nice journey yourself, peace out.
