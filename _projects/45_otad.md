Yesterday, talking about Dungeon Rap and Aleks, got me thinking again about one of my favorite accidental discoveries. One day, I was browsing through the new releases at Rush Hour, got a bit bored of the electronic music case and mixed things up by checking the smaller yet well furnished hip-hop case. Second album I peep is Still Comin’ Real by Shawty Pimp, I am immediately drawn to it because of the washed out cover art. I set it aside, look a lil’ longer for other albums, but shortly decide to just give this one a go. Imagine my stupefaction when this banger of a track starts playing…

And then and there, I standed astounded by my first taste of Memphis rap. Can a track get any smoother? I doubt it. Shawty Pimp’s flow seems to perfectly dance with this deepest of deep instrumental, with a [chord reminiscent of west coast tracks](https://youtu.be/thcbyFqyFHg), eazy-e gangsta rap style, yet hitting real mellow like [Tha Muthaphukkin Real](https://youtu.be/pMmRI86BkzU). Note that I have listened to the album front to back many times, as it’s a whole mood, yet if you only want the highlights (and cutting corners here is not recommended) I could speak highly of [Playas Aint Played With](https://youtu.be/BFseZwRFXUo) and [You Can’t Play No Playa](https://youtu.be/sAe_0YEkw-o) :-)

I hope to one day expand a lil’ more on gangsta rap, and its spiritual successor that is *dungeon rap*! Until then, hope you enjoyed this smooth cut, and peace out!
