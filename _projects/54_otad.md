    Source Direct - Secret Liaison (1996)
</div>

I recently had Adam over at mine for a night of beer drinking and music sharing, and we had  a funny coincidence. Not sure if this law has a name, you know when you only recently learned of the existence of a word; and suddenly you hear and see it everywhere? Well exactly this, but with an artist. Adam and I have apparently independently discovered the dnb group Source Direct. I discovered it through a random repost on reddit of a drum cover of their all time classic Secret Liaison, released on Good Looking Records in 1996, label [we already touched upon many times](/music/33_otad/). Adam discovered them by stumbling upon an old Dutch documentary about the UK dnb scene from 1996, where [SquarePusher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96PfTcGHZ4Q&t=0s), [Photek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyKuzY52hWU&t=0s), and [Source Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVnm5cdNcus&t=0s) are interviewed and asked to talk about their music. And so when I played the drum cover to Adam, he was like no way!! And proceeded to show me this video.

    LolaDaMusica - Part 3 of a documentary on DnB (interview with Source Direct)
</div>

Everything about this documentary is legendary, and as a comment points out, a treasure trove for samplers. So much so that you may recognize the voice at 01:29: “we just used to like… do our own thing”, which was famously sampled by [Joy Orbison in his Ellipsis track](https://youtu.be/ghz2klpZLr4) from 2012. The very start is so funny, when he parks his car and says *“this is source direct, we’re making drum n bass music for the next century… check the rims”*; self-fulfilling prophecy much? ahah. This video [has a similar energy to the episode 135.3dB](https://youtu.be/T3lrSDBs-1E) of the Belgian documentary series called Strip Tease.

One last track before going, the track popping up at 04:10 in the documentary, a remix by Photek (which we talked about under his Sentinel alias) of Therapy? - Loose. Crisp ambient dnb, sonic painting of 1996, the part after 02:20, when the ambient chords come and the melancholic guitar riff cries and echoes around… hmmm goose bumps all over.
