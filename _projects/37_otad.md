    Deepchord presents Echospace - Burnt Sage (2009)
</div>


Today’s pick is one of my all time favorites, a track I would probably send on [a golden vinyl in space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) if we ever had to send a new one. Liumin is a masterpiece, as the discogs notes puts it, a *mystical vibroacoustic-phenomena culled from the aether above Tokyo*. What makes it even more special is that I offered the CD to my mother, hoping she’d get into it, and man did she get into it. Every time I come back home, our first evening is just us, sitting in the living room, drinking a couple Belgian beers and listening to the album, over and over again until we are too tired to keep speaking.

Burnt Sage in particular is unfathomably nostalgic, or put it another way it describes better what nostalgia feels like to me than the word itself. I always get so emotional when listening to this track, it is so deep, mellow, reminiscent of reassuring yet bygone times. I picture myself at my grandma’s, back when I was a kid, clueless, naive, playing in the garden with not a care in the world. The radio faintly playing in the kitchen as I was walking downstairs, the sound of my grandfather turning the page of his newspaper, the smile of my grandmother, the rays of light piercing through the veranda. A truly beautiful, timeless moment, that I will never get to live again. What a peculiar feeling, as the very fact that I will never experience it again is what makes life what it is, exciting, however puzzling and sad it can sometimes feel. A life-changing book that helped me grasp this concept is *Tous Les Hommes Sont Mortels* by Simone de Beauvoir (1946), but I digress.

Hope you enjoy this track, and note that I highly recommend listening to the full album! See you tomorrow for more deep sounds from Deepchord!
