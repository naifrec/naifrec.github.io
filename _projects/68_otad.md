Traveled to Paris again today, as I make my way to my mother’s, after 9 months of being separated by covid. But first staying at my girlfriend’s, together with her roommates, our beloved duo [Sorok Pervyï](/music/14_otad/). As we came together to make some delicious gyoza, Antoine played some records. As always, quite the selection. As a first example, he introduced me to Cortex, a French jazz fusion group from the 70’s. He has a copy of their album *Pourquoi*, released in 1978, which sits comfortably with the presupposed funky vibes of the era, here is for instance the first track: *Sans Toi*.

Quite some vibes and it’s also both eerie and lovely to hear some French lyrics on top of such a funk track, in particular the long chorus at the end with super cheesy lines like *Sans toi le Sud serait le Nord* (without you South would be North). Ahah gotta love the aura surrounding this genre, again a good fit for some nice afternoon chill at Romain’s, definitely need to buy him this record, and recommend you not to stop at the first track as [there’s plenty more where it’s coming from](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8QD1Lg4YLdWDkIZG-Zx5IaQF0-10MiYt)!

Anyway! Another good record Antoine took for a spin this evening was [Mallard - Verte](https://wearerhythmsection.bandcamp.com/album/verte), which got me intrigued right away as I recognized the logo of the label: Rhythmic Section International, which [we discussed back in March to celebrate 3/03](/music/10_otad/) through their [SHOUTS release](https://wearerhythmsection.bandcamp.com/album/shouts-5-years-of-rhythm-section-intl). The whole EP was a blissful experience, as the bandcamp release describes it is *[e]qually at ease on the dance-floor as it would be for an introverted headphone session*.

My pick from his EP, Untitled, is a lush and esoteric breaks track. Drum programming and production in general showcase a lot of finesse, turning this otherwise minimalist track into quite a journey, with a bit of all kinds of genres, the part near 04:00 being very reminiscent of dreamy dub techno for instance. I would highly recommend listening to the whole EP cover to cover though, as the entire EP has a consistent atmosphere worth experiencing as a whole.
