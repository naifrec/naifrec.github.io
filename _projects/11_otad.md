Yesterday I played High Tone - Opus Incertum (2000), an album from my teenage years, back when I was adding frantically any video I liked to my “favorites” on YouTube, back when YouTube had not become what it is today. There were no rules, no structures, no big channels, certainly no YouTubers. Random people were uploading 98kbps mp3 rips of their favorite tracks, which at the time you could rate on a scale from one star to five. And I can vividly remember having the opening track [Delhi - Katmandou](https://youtu.be/2uz73vtiFbc) in there, although the original video was deleted. Unfortunately, my “favorites” playlist is an absolute graveyard, it is a great testament to the short life expectancy of content online.

Anyway, as I was playing the album on Spotify, when it came to an end, the related radio started playing. It picked this track, from an album I had never come across: High Tone - Do Be Dub Addict.

Needless to say this is an instant love, combining killer dub riddim, reggae sounds and… jungle. Truly evolving piece, starting from a nasty kick which somehow manages to go hand in hand with the dub on top. Tension ever so slowly builds up to release all of its energy half way through the track with some crazy percussion sounds and deep bassline, shifting from home to club in an instant, yet managing to pull this off smoothly. Brilliant. Enjoy!
