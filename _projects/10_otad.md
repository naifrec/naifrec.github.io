Today is 3/03, where we celebrate probably the best accidental discovery in music history, where a bassline sequencer meant to accompany a guitar becomes ubiquitous in electronic music for its signature, sulfuric sounds. I will share my most recent acid anthem, or summer track if you will: Research Club - Café Iguana.

While I know very little about the [artist himself](https://www.discogs.com/artist/7255812-Pablo-Arrangoiz), I can say I highly recommend the compilation this track appears on, which celebrates the 5 years of a label I definitely need to dig more into: [Rhythmic Section International](https://wearerhythmsection.bandcamp.com/album/shouts-5-years-of-rhythm-section-intl). Some personal favorites are [LT - Wet Look](https://youtu.be/qFsgsFX69Ao), a washed out track, in the middle of lofi house and jungle, and [Mali-I - Fire & Ice](https://youtu.be/uwZGV46Xl9E), also in between two genres, definitely dub, but clearly micro house. I think this summarizes quite well what this compilation manages to pull off: it is always where you least expect it, playing with genres and blurring frontiers, while remaining easy to listen to.

Café Iguana is no exception, a downtempo track playing with deep house tropes, but using acid laser shots to get your hips moving on a subtly breaked track, with carefully orchestrated vocal samples - reminiscing of the best jungle tracks out there - and birds singing in the background; making the entire thing feel fresh and tropical. Instant love. Enjoy.
