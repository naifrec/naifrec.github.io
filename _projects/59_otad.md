You’d think from the cover that I am sharing yet another track from an obscure PS1 game, well no but close enough. Today’s pick is from a fav artist of mine, DJ Playstation.

I came across DJ Playstation through his more renowned alias Maukook. He is a French artist from Lyon, who “blew up” in 2015 after releasing acid bangers after acid bangers, in particular [Maukook - Monotone](https://youtu.be/64Q7ZmE8A_U). I think the separation of concern between the two aliases is Maukook for more techno-oriented releases, and DJ Playstation for anything closer to dnb and breaks (which would make perfect sense given the prevalence of dnb in PSX games, and in video games in general, [we talked about this no later than Monday](/music/57_otad/)). His discogs and bandcamp shows that he is no short of aliases, and that he is also a heavy producer. I definitely recommend checking out [the entire catalog](https://djplaystation.bandcamp.com): it often hits, rarely misses.

Press Start hits the nostalgia button pretty hard, with the iconic PS1 startup sound at the beginning, and a very melancholic take on atmospheric jungle overall. This track speaks to me well when I feel down, and given how tearful I am listening to this right now, I guess I must feel pretty down. So here is a comment to comfort me in the idea I am not the only one tearing up to this:

    Man, man, man. Dj Playstation...so much emotions just in the name. Remeber pumpin amazing games on that old grey box. And then this music. You're hitting nostalgia levels that shouldn't even be possible!

Before going; here is another favorite of mine from him: after hell. It clearly builds on the same energy, describing empty worlds where total destruction is painted as an opportunity to build again, to rise from our ashes and become alive again, to shine light for future generations to see; after hell took the beauty of life away from us all.
