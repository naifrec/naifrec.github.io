Today is a sad day. We learned that the barn where we organised so many parties was sold, Edouard’s grandmother had to move out to go to a nursing home, and the family had to sell the property. We did not organize a point blank there since September 2019, as the ronnie did not allow for a 2020 version of a party we had held at least once if not twice a year. It feels so utterly strange that we will never get to give a proper goodbye to this place, which has hosted some of the best parties of my life. Today I would like to pay an homage to where it all started for us, a place which has given us all so many great moments, which has united me with distant friends through a common party, which has helped me grow as a DJ and music aficionado in general.

For me it’s hard to single out a track which would really make Point Blank justice. This noneoftheabove remix though was one of our many anthem tracks. Point Blank always ended up being some nasty acid techno mosh pit near 4-5am, with people barely clothed fighting through the smoke, riding the tiger; guardian of the subwoofers. Lasers beaming through the clouds, strobe lights till sun rise, sweat and smiles everywhere. Coming down from the heat of the night, we would gather around the fire just outside of the barn, in these old sofas, finishing the last few fresh beers and exchanging some confused words. Like sunflowers, we would all turn to the rising sun and sink slowly into a stasis one could label sleep.

I wish I had more time to dedicate for this homage. I will surely go back and record a DJ set in memory of a formative place for me and my friends. Thank you to all that were a part of this adventure. In particular, I extend my thoughts and wishes of good health to his grandmother, the kindest soul, as without her none of this would have been possible.

From the ashes of this project, we will rise again... We will be back, one way or another.
