The [other day](/music/46_otad/) I was shouting out [BBL’s dnb mix](https://www.radiopanik.org/emissions/all-we-need-is-acid/all-we-need-is-acid-saison-2/) for All We Need Is Acid on Radio Panik, and while I could basically select any track at random and make it my pick of the day without missing the target, I must say one track in particular caught my attention.

Are we listening to the most amazing crossover between the dubby chords of dub techno and the drum programming of jungle / dnb? If not this is undoubtedly one of the best tracks flirting with these two genres. I really dig the intro; with the glitched sounds popping in and out; the echoing distant chords, and the amazing build up with the filtered drums. The track fills so much space, kind of reminiscing of recent [Harrison BDP tracks](https://youtu.be/q2xcKx3A-F8), but with a much harder twist on the drums. What I love with this kind of tracks is that you definitely want to put them in your “chill” playlist; but you clearly can’t because yea, it’s a fucking banger that makes you want to [hit the drums like a madman](https://youtu.be/KwWxL5JcCu4).

Some last words before tuning out, take careful note of the channel who posted the video: [ballacid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcHqeJgEjy3EJTyiXANSp6g). Hard to find better consistency in the quality of uploads than this channel, consistently putting out there some spanking electro, ankle-twisting breaks, and in general anything containing [highly distorted amen breaks](/music/25_otad/). Enjoy!
