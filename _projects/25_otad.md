As you may know, we (used to  :disappointed_relieved:) regularly organize parties in a barn deep in Normandy’s countryside, at my mate grandma’s. Over more than 10 editions of these parties, I most of the time would play the opening sets from 10pm to 1am or so, as my lush, deep micro minimal style best fit this time slot. But for the last edition in September 2019, I told myself: fuck it, do the opposite of what you’ve been doing. I had recently experienced a [MAD night in Bret](https://appimin.com/web/event/bret-breakcore-night-w-luke-vibert) where Luke Vibert and Mad Miran absolutely destroyed the dancefloor with some nasty breakcore, one the many genres seemingly spawned from a single sample, [the amen break](https://youtu.be/v89CjsSOJ_c). My hunt for some breakcore tracks beginned, crystallized in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBLV0mgoy14r3FmwOW-TQ7tD2_ALcXvyg).

Of all the myriad of subgenres breakcore has, my favorite has to be ragga jungle / ragga core. Who would have thought that dub riddims and reggae voices would fit so well with the amen break, it’s like they were meant for each other. FFF’s track above is a prime example of the genre, sent to me by my mate Boyan. In a way this track is reminiscent of [High Tone - Do Be Dub Addict, which we discussed a couple weeks back](/music/11_otad/). I would describe it as a lot more percussion focused; as anything breakcore the interesting part is in the drum programming, where in an IDM-fashion artists cook up some of the most intricate drum patterns to exist. What really sets it apart is this amazing: “The Kim Kardashian of Sound Clash!!” right before the percussion track implodes near 02:00 ahah.

If you enjoy this track and are only just discovering the genre, here are a couple ragga core tracks I particularly enjoy: [Shitmat - Dubplate Murder Sound](https://youtu.be/KrI6TKBsSe8) and [Crooklyn Dub Consortium - Jacob’s Ladder (Version)](https://youtu.be/Yth6sC0EOpQ). Have a good one!
