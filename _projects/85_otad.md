These days my internet connection is so bad that I mostly rely on my iTunes library, sorry I mean “Music” library to find my track of the day. Small little detour about this rebranding, which I find so irritating. How pretentious do you have to be to simply rename your software “Music”? Can you imagine writing a new Operating System and just calling it Operating System? Oh way, that’s what Apple did too kek. Not only is it pretentious, but it’s just some SEO bullshit, now everybody has to type “Apple” along with “Music” in that sweet Google Search and *slurp slurp slurp* these sweet hits.

Alright, this rant out of the way, let’s get back to our track of the day. I wanted to start the week smoothly, with some nice dub techno sounds if possible. As I was going over my playlist, one track jumped out: Beat Pharmacy - Drifter.

I have fond memories of listening to this track with Romain on the HS8 when we were still sharing a flat, in our beginnings in Amsterdam circa 2016. We were mesmerized by the funky organ and guitar riffs, and of course the amazing trumpet; an instrument rarely used in a non-cheesy way in electronic music, to remain polite. In general, this track is reminiscent of [the glory hours of house music](https://youtu.be/dZDnC17uWmA), when it was incorporating a lot of live instrumental sounds; yet with a deeply dub tech spin to it.

Solo after solo, this track will get you in many different places; all happy ones though. Clearly uplifting this track delivers what it was branded for: a beat pharmacy, medication for the hurting minds of our people. I hope you enjoy this nice interlude, as for me… YouTube decided to autoplay a track I have already shared here… [Pinewood Lodge by Deepchord](https://youtu.be/Gv-EYfXccWc). See you on the other side.

PS: Beat Pharmacy is a very prolific artist, if you like this; chances are you will like some of his other work. You could start with his *Constant Pressure* album, available on Spotify. [Velocity](https://youtu.be/IuYmL_kQp70) could be a nice bait to make you listen to the rest of the album :-)
