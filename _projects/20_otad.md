As I was proofreading (post deployment… :slightly_smiling_face: :gun:) [my article on breakbeat](https://naifrec.github.io/music/6_otad/), I had a flashback to an amazing label I did not mention there: [Holding Hands](https://holdinghandsrecords.bandcamp.com/). I originally found it through its founder; [Desert Sound Colony](https://www.fluxmusic.net/an-interview-with-desert-sound-colony/), whom I first discovered through his track Fast Life, released on [Touch From A Distance](https://touchfromadistance.bandcamp.com/) in 2018.

I looked into Touch From A Distance because I had read that the creator, Nick Höppner, was a former manager of the landmark label Ostgut Ton, i.e. the label of Berghain. The first track of the EP is the only that really caught my attention; but man what a track. So epic in proportion, almost feels like the soundtrack to some badass video game, yet I am probably influenced by the equally cool cover art. One of the sample used also caught my attention, here is a quote of my comment on the video above:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
    wait, am i trippin or the sound at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWQr7Q3OgEU&t=101s">01:41</a> is just the sound of gunshot in MDK with a lot of echo?? i mean listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWQr7Q3OgEU&t=280s">this vid near the 04:40</a> mark
</div>

I am still convinced it’s the same sound; but yea it may be a happy coincidence that they sound the same, as I hardly see anyone going through the trouble of digging for MDK samples! We will probably never know!

Anyway! As I wanted to hear more from this young fellow; I did what I warmly recommend you doing if you are not yet doing it for artists you like: check out the labels he is releasing on! I quickly found Holding Hands, and my pick for today is Aunt Wendy’s Wedding in Wales from [the label 3rd release](https://desertsoundcolony.bandcamp.com/album/003-aunt-wendys-wedding-in-wales-i-c-jangles).

I think you should start understanding what Desert Sound Colony and his label are about: definitive party sounds, with enough weirdness to keep things interesting, yet enough catchy rhythms to get anyone dancing in a second. Hope you enjoy this dancefloor destroyer, and see you tomorrow for ambient Sunday!
