Dig the labels your favorite artists release on, the advice that just keeps on giving. Yesterday and the day before yesterday we mentioned Temple records, label co-run by [Ex-Terrestrial](/music/64_otad/), M. Salaciak (a.k.a. [Variant](/music/65_otad/)) and finally R Weng, author of my pick of today. In direct continuation of the deep space ambient techno from Variant, here is R Weng’s take on the genre with his track Seven Years from the [EP Life Principles](https://templerecordsofficial.bandcamp.com/album/life-principles), released back in 2016.

While in the same genre, R Weng’s ambient techno is a lot less bleak than Variant’s. This track slowly builds into an epic yet comfortable journey, where a flute will guide your steps through a primordial forest, the likes of Princess Mononoke or Nausicaa. 11 minutes have passed, a comparatively small amount of time given the evocative power they carry. True aural anxiolytic, hush lullaby, all that is needed in the mid-week work rush. Peace out.
