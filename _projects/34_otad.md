Remember last time I was talking about [Rom Di Prisco for his amazing productions for the Need For Speed games](/music/23_otad/)? Well I kept digging, as I realized I had only scratched the surface of his creative realm! Today’s pick, a track from Unreal Tournament 3, originally released for PC in 2007.

The ambient and drums at the start is really reminiscent of Good Looking Records / ambient drum n bass work of the mid 90’s. It remains impressively mellow for a track that goes that hard on the drums from time to time. A truly gorgeous piece, with a deep deep bass to work your sub and make your head bob. Love it! If you want to listen to more tracks from the OST, I suggest stopping by these few: [Defector](https://youtu.be/RSAS0f6xeMc), [Skylab 9000](https://youtu.be/g12WRxqQ620), [Skyward Fire](https://youtu.be/y70c4vaRslA) and last but not least [Mekalopolis](https://youtu.be/gSIrinW-zfo) (the beginning of the track… damn). You can find more video games nostalgia in [my YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSIrinW-zfo&list=PLBLV0mgoy14pNkrlw8NRKqAQEkmH216Mr&index=262).

Not sure where the trail of Rom Di Prisco (and of Jesper Kyd for that matter) will lead me next, but damn, with bones like this on the road I'mma follow it like a starved dog! Until the next one, hope you enjoyed the track and have a good one!
