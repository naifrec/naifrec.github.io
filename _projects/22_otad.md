Today was the first day in a year I went to the office, as the work from home order was given on the 13th of March 2020. Unintentionally celebrating the first year anniversary of working from home by going to the office, what are the odds. It was quite an odd experience, as the office was completely empty, it felt a bit surreal. But, to my surprise and a bit more on topic, on my desk was sitting a package I had received all the way back in December… which looked a lot like a record!

Yes you guessed it, my pick of the day came by post. This track… ahah! A lot to unpack here, from the artist name to the cover art, and of course the track itself. I would first like to recognize the genius of such an alias, as who could not want to click play on such a glaring oxymoron? What’s crazy is that he dared not lie, this “downtempo” gabber is pretty damn refined. The fat kick of gabber and the recognizable bass triggers gracefully dance with deep layers of ambient synths, and take a good 3 minutes to build back to full speed gabber, with a fast paced, bouncing around ending, a track to relax and slam dance to. Lastly, who could forget the cover, aptly describing the track, with a very “woke” dude “sleeping” on a “pill” ahah.

I realize now I actually know nothing of this artist nor the label it was released on, [Presto!?](https://prestorecords.bandcamp.com/), at a quick glance I saw releases from Donato Dozzy and DJ Stingray... definitely worth checking out to see if any other gems are hiding in there! Until then, hope you enjoyed the track and have a good one.
