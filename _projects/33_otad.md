Already been a week since [I last shared some nice ambient drum n bass](https://naifrec.github.io/music/24_otad/)! Can’t drag this for much longer. Today’s pick: Love & Happiness by PFM, released in 1994 on the amazing label we already talked about: [Good Looking Records](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ppXpzOSE2boUG3SpyiGSP?si=ZdiJmdiYToKtw811_Ouiwg).

Good Looking Records is a treasure trove of tracks just like this, although this one manages to stay above the pack. It is so epic, so 90’s too. The drum pattern is entrancing, so is the repetitive melody almost present from beginning to end, except during the lush bridge near 4 minutes, where a (cliche?) flute tries to make you reach the cotton clouds of dnb heaven. Somehow this track really jives with me, I am a bit sad to see the video that once existed on YouTube was removed for copyright claim. Someone had the amazing idea of using some old Second Life gameplay, and just hovering over empty cities, full of early 3D models of skyscrapers. It really gave the vibe of these album’s covers of the time, like Peshay Studio Set 1996.

Hope you enjoy this track, and the early 3D visuals of the set above hehe.
