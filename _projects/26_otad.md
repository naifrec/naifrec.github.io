You may have noticed my affinity with anything dub, from actual dub to ragga, passing by lush deep minimal tracks, but of course dub techno too. Dub techno is a genre I have a hard time finding in clubs, only very few acts I was at were actively dub techno. Not sure if it’s because its heydays are behind, as the genre is seemingly seeing some kind of revival in recent years, especially through a more micro / minimal take to it; with artists like [Romar](https://youtu.be/Z_fZYudCGaA), [Janeret](https://youtu.be/XiJ0dBzV_74) or [Andrey Puskharev](https://youtu.be/5cc9LRbZsIk), but also with the coming of age of ambient techno artists like [nthng](https://youtu.be/fCU3ShXB4Gc) or [Anthony Naples](https://youtu.be/emmqd3we7hU).

    Dub Taylor - Detect (2001)
</div>

The 90’s had its fair share of fast paced, dancefloor driven dub techno cuts, with artists that have a cult-like following in YouTube comments: [Basic Channel](https://youtu.be/CUD4RaRSSio) and [Vainqueur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOiqVejo4gk). Detect is one of the most refined examples of such track; although from a lesser known artist. Everything seems shaped within the noise of the ambient sample looping, sounds crackling and popping from this noise floor, chiseling a groovy bassline and chopped chords out of it.

I realize now through digging some info about Dub Taylor that he was close to Vladislav Delay (under his Luomo moniker), as they were both releasing on the same label, [Force Tracks](https://www.discogs.com/label/220-Force-Tracks); in the 2000’s. I think it explains how this dub techno sounds so close to [glitch ambient](https://youtu.be/vvW6qiTkZdw). [Next Sunday](/music/28_otad/) I will touch upon Vladislav Delay; if this name does not ring a bell to you, stay tuned!
