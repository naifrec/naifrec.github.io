It’s ambient Sunday again! Today’s pick comes again from the amazing duo [Sorok Pervyï](https://naifrec.github.io/music/14_otad/), my dear friends I had mentioned in [my article on Takashi Kokubo’s dreamy harp work](/music/14_otad/).

Antoine shared with me this album back in November 2020, and it is hard to count the number of times I have listened to it since then. He asked me if I had anything similar to offer him in return, but I am sad to say I know hardly anything quite like it. This albums just fucking flows, and as many masterpieces, lies at the frontiers of so many genres. I think this comment by the user Sci Fi best describes it:

The first track, uwëm/creātiōn, is a personal favorite. It starts with a subaquatic kick, like the heartbeat of your mother, still in the womb. A lush ambient loop plays in the background, until some distant chords play, [Terekke style](https://youtu.be/IXrmTMLEQRM), meaning it feels you hear everything behind a closed door, is my neighbor playing this or is it me? Ahah. But man is the highlight of the track from 03:40 onwards: a mysterious vocal plays, heavily buried behind all kinds of effects, and is shortly followed by a drum programmed to hit like a machine gun, deeply grooved within some heavy bass work. An absolute work of art.

Hope you enjoy this album as much as we do, and if you have anything like this lurking in one of your playlists, please reach out!
