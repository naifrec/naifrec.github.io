    Deepchord - CMOS Therapy (2015)
</div>

Yet another track from Deepchord, the dub techno master. This one holds a special place in my heart, as it is one of the first few records that spinned on my first record player in 2016. Romain brought it home after a digging session at Rush Hour, and came back with both EPs of the Atmospherica series!

The vinyl itself is so beautiful, almost like if it was carved out of emerald laced with amber. Somehow the grooves etched on it manage to match the beauty of their substrate. CMOS Therapy stands out from the tracks I previously selected through the sheer increase in BPM, which clearly shows a more dancefloor-driven production. While dub techno is usually pitched at the edge on danceability, this one track wants you to move. The repeated chords ring like a distant alert, shyly emerging from all the ambient samples playing over each other in a beautiful parade of soothing and wistfully melancholic sounds. Good music to get in the flow when coding!

Tomorrow will be the last day of our Deepchord special! Eager to share one last gem from Rod Modell!
