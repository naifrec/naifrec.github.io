In search of cute lilâ€™ sounds in my micro house playlists, I found one EP I particularly dig: Magic Vector by Lixir. Interestingly this type of track is what makes you either hate or love micro house. Some will find this utterly uninteresting, while some will just want to cuddle with the cute, minimalistic and reassuring grooves of these electronic lullabies. I guess you already know which group I am part of. Comfortably nestled in the warmth of this bassline, I am but a mere observer of the intimate story unfolding during this quiet journey across a pastel soundscape.

Before signing off, quick reminder to give the other track a virtual spin, which will unfortunately never be physical, as this beautiful piece will likely never see a pressing. Quite a shame considering the splendid work on the cover art, would have loved having it lying around in my living room.
