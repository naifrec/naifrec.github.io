I remember having this track on repeat at my first job, as I was learning the intricacies of coding in Python (and the horrors of static graph handling in [theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano), damn has the machine learning scene changed since then). The video, created by [hurfyd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzeR0_RWnpNHe6y4DTLwE5Q), a legendary digger and video producer on YouTube, is quite on point, as he picked an iconic GTA 5 mission where Michael floats around the city, high as fuck on acid, and just added a bunch more filters to add to the confusion.

This track truly embodies the “dazed and confused” type of deep house, all layers of sounds blend, there is nothing you really listen to, do you listen to this track or just hear it? Is this track real? Are you real? I personally find this type of sound very relaxing, a turn your brain off and let the feels flow kind of experience.

I realize now this is probably my first encounter with [Natural Sciences](https://naturalsciences.bandcamp.com/), a favorite label of mine, especially through [Mutant Joe's creations](https://naturalsciences.bandcamp.com/album/home-invasion-anthems). I will discuss it in length one day I am sure. Until then, I hope you enjoy this track as much as I do. Cheers.
