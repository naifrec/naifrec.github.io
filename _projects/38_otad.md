    Deepchord - Prana (2013)
</div>

Today we continue our week dedicated to Deepchord - one of the pillars of dub techno - with his track Prana, released in 2013 on Soma Quality Recordings. This soundscape sounds like an alternate track for Ice Cavern in Spyro The Dragon, perfectly matching the vibes of a cold winter night, inside a crystal cavern, with beautiful light reflections shining through stalactites of colored ice. This track stands out from the previous ones mainly through a lot more playful bassline, flirting with a nice and round kick. Definitely the most danceable of all.

Note that labels that released the tracks I shared so far are worth noting: [Soma](https://soma-records.bandcamp.com/) and Modern Love. These are big players, among the few electronic music labels that survive the test of time and keep themselves within relevancy over multiple decades. Notable releases, and by that releases I know I can recommend, would be [Claro Intelecto - Patience](https://youtu.be/mxqcOE4iiXY) on Modern Love, and well… [Daft Punk - Homework](https://youtu.be/q27KtfR1ESA) on Soma (yes you read that well).

Enjoy the deep tango of Prana, and read me tomorrow for more dub techno sweetness from Deepchord.
