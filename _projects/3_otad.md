I recently clicked randomize on my “deep house case” playlist and stumbled upon a track I added 3-4 years ago: Casino Times - Oddity (Moomin remix).

One may wonder how this ended up in my deep house case, when after a few floating seconds, the comforting sounds of liquid drum and bass make you drift in a nostalgic abyss. Well, it’s probably because at the time I didn't know better. I mainly knew Moomin for his deep house records. My first encounter with Moomin was on a track he co-produced with Oskar Offermann called [Hardmood](https://youtu.be/-ohmBxrCx-Q), which I found circa 2014, and quickly digged his other releases, as can be seen by the great many of his tracks that can be found in the playlist I shared (17 and counting…). He most notably introduced me to Smallville Records, which I will always associate with the childish yet genius art of their graphic designer Stefan Marx.

It is only a couple years later in 2019 that I rediscovered liquid drum and bass, through some old school classics like [Architex - Altitude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XZYRxZtIrU), [Chameleon - Links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA69L_7nRKU) or LTJ Bukem and the label he founded, Good Looking Records (this [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6ppXpzOSE2boUG3SpyiGSP?si=o5wQKG9fSmivjTLTtLn48Q) has 21h of those waiting for you). Liquid dnb is the “ambient” side of dnb, with many long evolving ambient layers in the background, few lyrics but the occasional inspirational sample from an obscure 90’s movie, and a repetitive yet hypnotizing drum pattern.

It has become the music of choice for racing games, and I highly recommend it as background music for trackmania if you are aiming to get those sweet author medals. Salute to riolu, one of the best trackmania players in the world, who made many montages with liquid as background music, like his recent 200 clean sweep, an impressive feat where he managed to hold the world record on all 200 tracks at the same time.
