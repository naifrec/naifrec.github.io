Boi o boi am I excited! D’you know what I randomly stumbled upon the other day? A Twitter handle dedicated to [drum and bass in video games](https://twitter.com/vg_dnb). An account I will surely follow closely from now on, and which has already posted quite a number of tracks so definitely go check it out. You will quickly recognize some of the names there, with the infamous Rom Di Prisco [which we already touched upon multiple times](https://naifrec.github.io/music/34_otad/), but also Squarepusher which we were mentioning no later than [last Friday](https://naifrec.github.io/music/54_otad/) as being one of the dnb OGs. I am of course already done going through all the uploads, and today is my favorite discovery from this nice digging session: Grand Unified - Le Hot, released in 1998 and part of Tony Hawk Pro Skater first entry on PSX, itself released in 1999.

I am yet to listen to the THPS series OSTs to scout for nice video games tracks, as similarly to GTA, I almost consider it cheating to check these out as I know already they will be gold mines, and my original goal was truly to unearth some hidden gems from long forgotten and messy 3D realms. But man is this the confirmation of my high expectations for this series! First things first, I love the name of the track, subtle jab at the French language with the ridiculous “le” hot. Second, what a bouncy, funky dnb track that is, yet still benefiting from most of the tropes of the ambient dnb we all know and love, with some lovely ambient pads and dub chords slowly filtered over 32 bars, making everything floaty and comfy; nomnomnom.

I want to extend my sincere gratitude to the owner of this twitter handle! Sharing is caring, peace out!

*PS: also, seeing this twitter account sparked an idea… be ready as I will soon program some kind of bot to post my daily articles to twitter, with a short excerpt of the text but also a short excerpt of the video! This will hopefully make it easier for my readers to follow my OTAD series.*
