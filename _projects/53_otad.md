    A Strange Wedding - Through The Black Hole (2021)

A Strange Wedding and Worst Records strike again with their EP Black Magic Rituals, for which I just ordered the record to expand my collection of arcane items in case I would need to summon an ancient spirit some day. I recommend [the whole album](https://worst-records.bandcamp.com/album/black-magic-rituals) (including the digital exclusives), but the selected track - through the black hole - is one vortex of its own hot damn. The track takes the trance essentials, the bouncing kick line, the filtered, slow panning rave pads, and turns into a.. well a black magic ritual as the title would suggest. At the edge between home listening and dance track, this unconventional slow trance track will surely help you e x p a m d.

Suffice to say I am not short of slow trance tracks to share these days, so expect more soon! Peace out.
