Sometimes I stop and wonder what I would do if not for the internet and computers. I’ve been connected for so long now that it is second nature, I barely think about it; almost like breathing, but damn I spend most of my waking hours on a computer, and lose many potential sleeping hours to the computer. My job, as for many of my generation, is almost entirely on a computer, with close to no social interaction involved, especially these days that I am working from home and all my meetings are virtual. And sometimes this truth hits me quite hard, making me a bit depressed. I sometimes feel like in quarantimez, the short-film my mate Boyan produced last year in the first months of the pandemic, namely like some kind of holographic representation of myself in a fully digital world devoid of most senses but hearing and seeing.

    <p> An anxious over-philosophizer and an enthusiastic go-getter reflect on the surreal situation in the early weeks of their lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

While in this surreal philosophical essay I tend to take the side of Zonke more than Bonke, as I am convinced of a higher meaning of the sacrifice of our social life, hitting the one year mark has taken a toll on me, as it did on most of us I suppose. With little to no visibility on the cultural scene opening up again in the EU, with no visibility on when I will get a vaccine myself, with horror stories of new strains which evolved to maime even the younger generations with permanent brain damage or lung tissue scarring, with the continued social distancing making it hard to visit close family, this start of the year has been hard to apprehend.

That’s why sometimes I get bored of being on my computer, but I know nothing better but to be on my computer, so is the paradox. I am afraid this is an incredibly sorrowful introduction to my pick of the day, from a group that probably deserved a much better, or at least more uplifting, preface: Newcleus.

    Newcleus - Computer Age (1984)
</div>

Newcleus is probably my favorite early electro act (with [Egpytian Lover](https://youtu.be/EfTg3ymB4lg) as close second). Both albums, *Jam on Revenge* and *Space is the Place*, are masterpieces absolutely riddled with electro bangers. Computer Age hits particularly on target with the topic of today, with quite prophetic lyrics for a track released in 1984:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
    Computer age is now <br/>
    Everyone must have a machine <br/>
    They say it's gonna make life easier, <br/>
    Well, I can't stand it… <br/>
    <br/>
    They say we should put them in control <br/>
    Well, maybe next we'll give them a soul <br/>
    I guess we must now think that we're gods, <br/>
    While we're less men than ever <br/>
    <br/>
    I know the Lord cannot be too glad <br/>
    In fact, I'm sure he must be quite mad <br/>
    To see us take His role from our lives <br/>
    And give it to computers <br/>
    <br/>
    For here we sit in our easy chairs <br/>
    As our machines decide how we'll fare <br/>
    Who will suffer, who will survive? <br/>
    It's up to the computers <br/>
</div>

Hope you enjoy this track and that life is treating you well. Peace out.

*PS: want more surreal videos in the style of quarantimez, one of Boyan’s inspiration for this video is the amazing channel called [surreal entertainment](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCChWvNbRQYQ5fj1Nj3RQu8Q), a personal favorite of mine us [Shrek interrogates Mark Zuckerberg](https://youtu.be/hLANUP4L1yA).*
