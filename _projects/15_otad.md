The other day [I shared a couple tracks from Hit Hz](/music/otad_12/), and noted at the end that one of his aliases was Salmanazar. It took me some time to find out why the name sounded familiar, then realized I recently stumbled upon his recent EP under this alias released on [Joules, a Yoyaku sub-label](https://yoyaku.bandcamp.com/music) I have been following fondly.

My first encounter with the label was through their 4th release, which I just randomly picked up when visiting their store once. A2 above is a memorable track which sits comfortably in my “dub house” playlist, a classic of mine. The label remains quite on brand, with carefully crafted dub releases across the catalog, very reminiscent of what Andrey Puskarev could play, something I also shared recently.

I recently discovered Yoyaku had uploaded their catalog to bandcamp, and spun up the latest releases from Joules to test it out. [Salmanazar’s EP, Objects](https://yoyaku.bandcamp.com/album/joule09-objects-ep), did not leave too much of an impression at first, A side is really not my thing… but when B1 started… holyshit.

How to describe this track? It’s again flirting with many different genres. The signature scratch sound, the percussion and chopped samples make it sound like a break / jungle track, yet the meticulous layering, bassline and overall orchestration secure a decisive micro house vibe. Love at first sight again. Enjoy!
