I am still surfing the barrels born from the ripples of my digging through Ex-Terrestrial and his friends' work. Someone from his entourage I did not mention yet is dust-e-1, who is also known under multiple monikers: [Killer DJs](https://youtu.be/L29xH15PvN0) when working with [Big Zen](https://youtu.be/2dBhGDUR150), and [ANF](https://youtu.be/aQCExus-k7w) when working with [Priori](/music/67_otad/). As I was researching him, I found his nice interview from the Montreal-based magazine Never Apart. The format of their series of articles is pretty cool, going by the name of “Six Picks”, Never Apart asks one artist to pick 6 tracks and explain why they are significant to them. It’s crazy because from listening to his picks, tracks like [Untitled](https://youtu.be/L29xH15PvN0) make a lot more sense to me, I can definitely visualize better how he came to such sounds.

    Pilgrims of the Mind - Good Morning Angel (1996)
</div>

My pick of the day is my favorite from his own picks, the one from Pilgrims of the Mind called Good Morning Angel. True downtempo marvel, this is a 5am track, as the sun goes up on a tireless crowd, to make you float around like sun dust as the first ray of lights shine through the trees. Timeless track, relevant then; relevant now, relevant forever. There sure must have been quite some pilgrimage inside the ramified depths of the souls of many ravers.

Good morning angel… peace out.
