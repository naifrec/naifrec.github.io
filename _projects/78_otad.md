I will be dedicating this week to [Point Blank](/music/76_otad/), as a last goodbye, picking from the best tracks that we have played there throughout the years. I will try to keep it chronological to outline the progression in genres that operated throughout just over 5 years of existence.

We will start from the beginning, the first ever party in the Skuat, which was for the New Years Eve 2014/2015. It is one of the only for which we actually have a recorded set, the one from Edouard, who at the time called himself Z.point, but is now known as [Silence Science](https://soundcloud.com/silence-science). His set starts with a small edit he made himself, and is in general crafted with great care. Edouard never plays a set on the spot, he practices it many times, refines the track order until he gets the perfect mix... thinking back these were probably early signs of his affinity [for music production](https://soundcloud.com/silence-science/sets/resilience-ep)!

His first recorded set was no different, and was already quite professional with very little to nothing to say technically. We were working with two Traktor X1 and a Xone DB4, quite a cool setup, that Edouard quickly mastered. This shows as the set flows perfectly, starting with techno, then slowly morphing into industrial techno. I remember the live experience of it was something, it was my first time testing the soundsystem we had bought together and that remained the same for the upcoming years: [the box TA Power Bundle](https://www.thomann.de/intl/the_box_ta_power_bundle.htm). It was expensive, but we had saved up quite some money during our respective internships and had decided to go big and invest in this place. Edouard went a lot further by spending almost an entire year building the place from the ground up using scrap pallets, erecting an actual DJ booth on top of what used to be a cow feeder. We had also bought a smoke machine and some lights. Try to imagine how happy I was experiencing all of this for the first time, with Edouard kicking the best set.

If I can isolate one track from this absolute mental set, it would be the one from Clouds, called Radical Cutting Method.

This one is quite the belter, starting at 35:40 during the set, it wraps the transition into the second half of the set, much faster and heavier. I did not know Clouds until the moment he first played it that night. God damn, I was fucking blown away. It was like he was fucking steamrolling all over us, it was soooo heavy, with the two subwoofers the sounds pressure was sky high! I was so happy, grinning like a madman... everything far exceeded my expectations, and outdid any club experience I had ever had. When the track shortly filters to concentrate on the grater of a sound in front near 02:00… The “crowd” of 20 friends went absolutely crazy. To think that he shortly followed with [Truss - Brockweir](https://perctrax.bandcamp.com/track/brockweir) and then [Blawan - Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage](https://youtu.be/1mR6zmSTDNE)… What a way to open the festivities. Respekt.

A night to remember for sure…
