Today is not just ambient Sunday, it’s the first day I got to see my mother in more than 9 months. I was so excited to finally go back home, see my family again, chilling “home”. As I walked this morning through Saint-Lazare, with this beautiful spring sun shining through the glass ceiling, I got nostalgia struck and came to a hard realization. Each year passing, *Time* by Pink Floyd seems more and more relatable. While clearly not ambient, since this track resonates and has resonated with me for so long, I would love to share it with you today, together with its lyrics which are worth pondering on.

    Pink Floyd - Time (1973)
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
    Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day <br/>
    You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way <br/>
    Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town <br/>
    Waiting for someone or something to show you the way <br/>
    <br/>
    Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain <br/>
    You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today <br/>
    And then one day you find ten years have got behind you <br/>
    No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun <br/>
    <br/>
    So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking <br/>
    Racing around to come up behind you again <br/>
    The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older <br/>
    Shorter of breath and one day closer to death <br/>
    <br/>
    Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time <br/>
    Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines <br/>
    Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way <br/>
    The time is gone, the song is over <br/>
    Thought I'd something more to say <br/>
    <br/>
    Home <br/>
    Home again <br/>
    I like to be here <br/>
    When I can <br/>
    <br/>
    When I come home <br/>
    Cold and tired <br/>
    It's good to warm my bones <br/>
    Beside the fire <br/>
    <br/>
    Far away <br/>
    Across the field <br/>
    Tolling on the iron bell <br/>
    Calls the faithful to their knees <br/>
    To hear the softly spoken magic spell <br/>
