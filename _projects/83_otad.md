    Unknown Artist (ODE) - 0000FF A (2014)
</div>

A deep groover I have played countless times, especially in my warm ups at point blank, is the track called 0000FF A released on [ODE](https://www.discogs.com/label/136203-Ode), a label where all releases are unsigned. An ode to music itself, one cannot have a priori since the composer is left to the imagination of the listener. This deep deep house always gets me, 10 minutes long? Feels like 2. I am probably responsible for more than 100 plays on this vid.

Words cannot nearly describe the warmth I feel through the depth of the low frequencies this track has to offer. Like a comfortable lounge, a sonic sofa, things will stop hurting as truth is spoken slowly to you and the unattentive crowd around you. Are you listening? I can’t say I am; although I am nodding indeed. Let this track be our lil’ secret garden, our elixir. Enjoy.
