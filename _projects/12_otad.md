When I first started digging electronic music back in 2012-2013, right at the end of preparatory school, I was mainly listening to minimal and deep house. I would go every Sunday evening to my friend’s, Charles, and we would listen to his latest findings. The very first track I remember him sharing was the deep house track [Matt John - Ocean Inside](https://youtu.be/-bst3cQ9M2s). I was absolutely crazy with this track, it went so fucking deep during the first minute. To be honest listening to it nowadays I just wish there would be a dub edit without these irritating vocals on top.

Not everything we listened to was electronic music, I remember playing on repeat [Set & Match - Sunset](https://youtu.be/wwdWAsPyA90), our summer track. However we did spend most of our time listening to “electro” as we used to call it, and French one of course! How could we forget [Pursuit by Gesaffelstein](https://youtu.be/1ExdigjJmaA) for instance?

Charles did have a preference for minimal, cute, deep tracks though. I remember sitting on his sofa, completely blazed out of my mind, listening to [Faster - Finished Portrait](https://youtu.be/YkPzSKFpm7s). This was my first encounter with truly minimal music, or let’s say something different from the minimal that sounds like Paul Kalkbrenner. This was truly different, extremely slow in its evolution, so damn precise in the layering and orchestration, with an incredibly deep moment at 04:30 with echoing chords and these weird samples of cars honking in the background. I was definitely into this shit.

The track I picked today combines all of these genres he made me discover in the first place: the deepness of deep house and the precision of minimal. A 50Hz chord plays in the background, a buried kick caresses your ears, stumbling every 8 beats, keeping things moving. Comes a deep voice, warning you about the pulse of rhythmic healing, until it fades into an echoey break. The rest is pure bliss. Enjoy!

PS: if you dig this, I highly recommend browsing through Hit Hz releases, and the back catalog of Recordeep which this track was released on. I will leave you with another track from the French producer Hit Hz, also known as Salmanazar.
