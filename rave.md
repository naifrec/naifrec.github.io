# How to organize your own rave: a guide

About 4 years ago, my friend Edouard and me decided we really wanted to start
organizing our own raves. We had been fucking around with Traktor in our
bedrooms for long enough, it was time to bring up the show. So we decided
to invest in gear, and there was a lot of different stuff to think about: the
soundsystem (both for the public but also the monitoring for the DJ's), the
setup for the DJ's (what mixing table, what players, what software), the location,
the power supply, the access to decent toilets, etc. Then once again last year,
my friend Romain and me decided to organize raves again, and I had to go again
in that thought process, and I found little guidance on the web, or let's say
that it is super spread out, and never exactly addressing my point: create the
best setup for an electronic music rave.

In this blog post I hope to share with you all the tips and tricks, the
manufacturers and the links you'll need to kickstart the rave of your own. I
will focus on portable rave setups for roughly 100 persons, which is the latest
kind of raves I organize, as the one I am organizing with Edouard turned out
simpler since we have a fixed location, with power supplied by the city grid.
I will assume no prior knowledge of anything related to audio equipment and
music and try to define all jargon in layman's terms.

I will cover the following topics:

* the soundsystem
* the DJ setup
* TODO: the VJ setup?
* the power supply
* the location
* the promotion
* summary

## 1. The soundsystem

*Note: this section will be strongly biased since I only ever tested 2 brands:
RCF and Thomann TI box.*

In this section we will go over the basics of:

* what speakers to buy and why?
* what cables to buy and how to wire everything together?

### 1.1 What speakers to buy and why?

A soundsystem is usually defined by its watt consumption, since it basically
correlates one to one as how loud it will get. So each component of a soundsystem
will be chosen for its power usage (measured in kW) and its specific range
of frequencies it reproduces. By that I mean that a typical soundsystem comprises
2 types of speakers: 2 or more regular loudspeakers which produces frequencies from 50 Hz
to 24,000Hz (the entire audible spectrum by the human ear), and 1 or more subwoofers
which focuses on the range 50 to 100 Hz, for the bass.

TODO: insert a graph of the frequency spectrum to explain low / mid / highs

Why have different speakers for different frequency bands? Well because the
membrane size and overall speaker shape changes depending on which frequency you
want to reproduce. Having a subwoofer in addition to regular speakers often
allows the lower end of the spectrum to stand out, and allow the loudspeakers
to spend more energy on the mid and high ends.

When raving outside, for a group of approximately 80-100 people, what you need
is a system of a little more than 1 kW RMS. It's not crucial to have a subwoofer,
depending on how good your speakers are. My current setup is the following:

* 2 x [RCF 315A loudspeakers]() (~300 euros each) at 400W RMS each, peaking at 800W.
* (optional) 1 x [RCF 705-AS II subwoofer](https://www.thomann.de/gb/rcf_sub_705_as_ii.htm) (~1000 euros) at 700W RMS, peaking at 1.4 kW.

I find the RCF loudspeakers to be of exceptionally clear quality, with an extremely
flat response. What this means is that across all the frequencies between 50Hz
to 24,000Hz, none are either attenuated nor boosted. Low quality speakers
often artifically boost the lower ends, since people tend to get tricked into
thinking a speaker is good when it sounds fat. Believe me you don't want that.
A flat response is easier to work with as a DJ, you then have all the freedom
to boost the bass yourself on the mixer equalizer (EQ), instead of having to tune your
EQ to the actual speaker. Bad quality speakers also tend to screw up the very high ends,
and will hurt the ears of your audience on loud hats. But this pair of RCF... I
actually use them as monitoring at home, that's how good they are, while still
being loud enough to throw a fucking party. Final note on the loudspeakers, it
is crucial to have them on tripod stands so they are at head height, otherwise
the sound will die out after only a couple layers of dancers.

Then, when I have enough power, I sometimes add the subwoofer. It's really cherry
on the cake at this stage, but also pretty cool to have when leaning towards bass
heavy electronic music (like hardcore, acidcore, dnb, etc.). I chose this specific
subwoofer because it's the most compact and portable 15 inch woofer on the market,
and because RCF fucking kills. Contrary to loudspeakers, you do not need a stand
for your subwoofer, as low frequencies travel much further and are less impacted by
human mass. Subwoofer is most of times the element of your soundsystem that will
pump the most power (>1kW), so make sure you can afford it beforehand.

I would again really like to emphasize that if your wallet or power supply does not
allow, don't  think the party will be ruined from the lack thereof. I organized
multiple parties with only a pair of RCF and it kicked ass each time.

## 2. The DJ setup

Oh boi that's a tricky one. Also quite polarizing. So first of all, just so
you peepz know what camp I am in, fuck Pioneer and their expensive, heavy, cumbersome
bullshit. Now that this is out of the way, I will basically list the different
setups I had across the parties that worked, but also the ones that did not work.
You will be able to mix and match, but also learn which setups are too brittle to
try at a rave.

### 2.1 Setups that work and why

I would always recommend having an external mixer, and not rely only on the mixer
on a controller like a Traktor S4. The reason you do not want to rely on a mixer
of a controller, is because you basically put all the pressure on your soundcard. 
And when you start to have a lot of different sound sources, both analog (vinyls)
and digitals (CDJ's, controllers), while playing loud, it can lead to problems like
quiet output, skips, lags and freezes.

I have tested three mixers in my life, they all worked out fine, and I have no
personal preference, but if I had to buy one again I'd probably buy the Xone 92
just because it is the industry standard:

* [Allen & Heath Xone DB2](https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xonedb2/): a
  4-channels digital mixer with a soundcard which allows to use controllers like the
[Traktor X1](https://www.native-instruments.com/fr/products/traktor/dj-controllers/traktor-kontrol-x1/).
* [Allen & Heath Xone 92](https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xone92/): the
  workhorse of many clubs, 6-channels analogue mixer. Heavy, warm and reliable beast.
* [Pioneer DJM 800](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/506083-REG/Pioneer_DJM_800_DJM800_Four_Channel.html):
  4-channels digital mixer which quickly became the reference

For the media players, I use:

* 2 x technics SL1210 MKII for the vinyl players. I bought mine off this exceptional
  dude, [studio 4 holland](http://www.studio4holland.nl/), who basically refurbishes old
  technics parts and sell them just as new. I am so happy about everything, he
  even changed the LED color on one so I can recognize left from right, and took
  time to pair them so the pitch faders are synced. It will be 600 euros each,
  but worth every penny and guaranteed to work.
* 2 x [XDJ-1000MK2](https://www.bax-shop.nl/tabletop-cd-mediaspeler/pioneer-xdj-1000mk2-digitale-tabletop):
  they are basically the CDJ Nexus 2000 without the CD player. They are incredibly
  expensive for what they are, 1300 euro each. Only recommended if you already have
  a friend who can let them to you, or if you plan on offering the most streamlined
  setup to your DJs, since it will for sure be what most DJ expect and know how
  to play.
* 1 x [Traktor S4 MKIII](https://www.thomann.de/gb/native_instruments_traktor_s4_mk3.htm):
  By far the best cash to value on the market, being 780 euros for a 4-channel controller,
  with a mixer, and controls for filter and effects that will remind you of the DJM 800.
  It's packed with amazing features, and the best beginner setup ever. You can plug
  the master output to one of the channel of your external mixer, and off you go. 
  One could even think of a setup without external mixer, and plugging directly
  the output of the S4 to the soundsystem. If you really want to go portable,
  or don't have the money for the mixing table, you could, but as already mentionned
  above, you are running the risk of some issues if you start mixing analog sources
  with it too. Its main downside is that poser DJs will tell you that this thing
  is for kids (it's not), and some people won't play them because of that. The
  second downside is that it heavily relies on Traktor Pro, which in my experience
  ruined some sets because it can crash randomly. I hope that the new version (Pro 3),
  which I have not tested yet, will overcome this issue.

### 2.2 Setups that don't work and why

## 3. The power supply

Spoiler alert: **this is the part you don't want to fuck up**.

Here is a crash course in electrical engineering:

* power is measured in W
* the total Watt consumption of your system is the addition of the Watt consumption of its parts.

Easy right?

Now a little more complicated. Most manufacturers will state 2 figures for the
power consumption: the Watt RMS and the Watt peak. RMS stands for Root Mean Squared,
which essentially means the average consumption of the equipment across time. So
the RMS figure is the most important one, because it's the one you can expect the
equipment to consume most of the time. Now, the instantaneous power usage will
always be different from the RMS, and sometimes will be higher. The peak Watt
figure indicated how high it could go, in the worst case scenario.

So how do you use these 2 figures? Well dimension your power supply with respect
to the RMS figures, but leave some room to account for the peak. To give an example,
let's say I have the system described above: 2 x RCF315A at 300W RMS / 600W peak and
1 x RCF 705A at 700W RMS / 1,400W peak. You effectively need a power supply of
2 x 300 + 1 x 700 = 1,900W. However, due to the high peak count of each equipment,
I leave a 30% security margin, which roughly accounts for 600W (0.3 * 1,900 = 570).
So I would go for a generator of at least 2.5kW. Since in the end I will have to also
power all the DJ equipment, I will go for something closer to 3.5 kW.

So here are the things you will need to size up to the power usage of the system:

* the generator(s)
* the extension cords and power sockets

### 3.1 The generator(s)

There are 2 features you are looking for in your generator: its power suppy
**capacity** and if it's **surge protected**. The capacity should ideally be
20-30% above the total RMS power consumption of your system to account for peaks.
The surge protection is a protection against voltage surges. Most of your equipment
expects (in Europe) 230V. A gas-powered generator will do its best to provide
a stable 230V, but it can fluctuate. Surge protected generator basically
put a cap on how high that fluctuation could go. It is very important, because
a voltage surge could mean burning sensitive gear. I recently had a mate burning
a CDJ due to a voltage surge, believe me losing 1200 euros worth of equipment
because of that is a traumatizing experience (also, fuck you Pioneer for selling
your MP3 players for the price of a fucking motorbike).

The generator I so far have not bought, and only rented. The reason I do so is
because, as everything mechanical, I expect a lot of maintenance, so I prefer
renting so I am guaranteed to have a working engine. I may be wrong though, so if
you feel like buying it, go ahead. I am based in the Netherlands, so I can only
recommend Dutch retailers. If you happen to live in the Netherlands, I highly
recommend boels for renting. [Their 2kW generator]() is surge protected, very
silent and does not consume too much gasoline. They also provide the gasoline.

### 3.2 Extension cords and power sockets

First things first, you absolutely need an extension cord, and a long one.
A generator does not only generate power, it also generates a fuckton of noise.
Go for a 25 meters extension roll, so you are able to distance the generator
from your party.

Now, if you are outside, I would recommend to get extension cords and power
sockets which are both surge protected and waterproof. In all cases, you should
consider having a tarp where all the electrical gear can sit without fear of it
getting burried in mud.

For the number of power sockets: aim high. Some artist live setups take 5 to 6
power sockets alone. I have bought a couple of [12 x power sockets](). Again, try
to get them surge protected and waterproof.

Think of distributing the power across your extension cords, i.e. do not put
both speakers AND subwoofer on a single extension cord. The best is to pull two
extenstion cords from you generator(s) so you can split the load in two. The
way I usually split is the following:

* 1 extension cord for the speakers, the DJ gear and lights.
* 1 extension cord for the subwoofer, the VJ gear.
