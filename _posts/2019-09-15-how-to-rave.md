description: how to organize your own small scale rave with your friends
---

I have been organizing parties for close to 5 years now, both indoors and outdoors, mostly private events for my friends with roughly 50 people. In the process, I had to ponder about a lot of different choices: the soundsystem (both for the public but also the monitoring for the DJ's), the setup for the DJ's (what mixing table, what players, what software), the location, the power supply, the funding, etc.

I found little guidance on the web, or let's say that it is super spread out, and never exactly addressing my point: **create the best (affordable) setup for an electronic music rave for a small group of friends (~50 persons)**.

In this blog post I hope to share with you all the tips and tricks, the
manufacturers and the links you'll need to kickstart the rave of your own. I
will focus on portable rave setups for roughly 50-100 persons.

I will assume no prior knowledge of anything related to audio equipment and
music and try to define all jargon in layman's terms. I will cover the following topics:

* TL;DR: ravekit checklist
* Electronics
  * Soundsystem
  * DJ'ing
  * Lighting
  * Power supply
* Furniture
* Location
* Promotion / Funding

## 0. TL;DR: Ravekit checklist

Electronics:
* Public Address (PA):
    * 2 x speakers (recommend [RCF 310 A](https://www.thomann.de/gb/rcf_art_310_a_mk_iii.htm))
    * 2 x speaker stand (!)
    * (optional) 1 x subwoofer (recommend [RCF 705 AS II](https://www.thomann.de/gb/rcf_sub_705_as_ii.htm))
* DJ’ing:
    * [Native Instrument S4 MKIII](https://www.thomann.de/gb/native_instruments_traktor_s4_mk3.htm) (or S2 for cheaper, but only 2 channels), all-in-one
    * laptop stand
    * laptop with Traktor Pro 3
    * 1 x headset (recommend [Sennheiser HD-25](https://www.thomann.de/gb/sennheiser_hd_25.htm))
    * 2 x 3m XLR cables (4x if subwoofer)
* Power:
    * 1 x [generator 2.2 kW](https://www.boels.nl/en/hire/power-lighting/generators/electricity-generator-2-kva) (2x if subwoofer)
    * 1 x 25m cable roll (generator has to be put far away)
        * 2 rolls if subwoofer to avoid having too much power on one cord
    * [surge-protected power strip](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/cable-company-power-strip-with-surge-protection/9200000024132118) (at very least 5 plugs, 10 is safer)
* Lighting:
    * lightbulb strip
    * (optional) 2 x 300W [floodlights](https://www.boels.nl/en/hire/power-lighting/lighting/floodlights-1) during the night

Furniture:
* 3x3m [party tent](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/partytent-opvouwbaar-draagbaar-easy-up-paviljoen-party-tent-tentdoek-210-grams-3-x-3-m-wit/9300000002036447) (necessary to cover for rain / dew)
* table top (high enough to DJ), we usually go for:
    * plank of wood (can get one cut at Praxis)
    * piano x stand
* tarp to put on the ground below party tent (to avoid water to come on the power strip)

Transport:
* Rent a van on [snapcar](https://www.snappcar.nl/) or [getaround](https://www.getaround.com/) for cheap, P2P options
* Make sure you can park the van close to the location of the party (max 500m because you will have to carry all the shit listed above)
* If it is not an option to park the car/van close to location because it’s too deep into the woods, consider going for cargo bikes instead (bakfiets in Dutch).

Consumables:
* Bring a lot of water:
    * party people tend to forget that they are humans who need water to live
    * bring 2/3x large gallons of water
* Bring toilet paper
* Buy gas for your generator
    * can ask for more at boels when retrieving the generator
    * SP95 usually works with most of these engines, but do not quote me on it
* If you have a van; buy beers in crates and return the crates the next day, minimal waste
* Buy large, strong trash bags (scatter around location; notify people of their presence upon arrival, regularly check if they are full and replace)
* Bring many ashtrays (scatter around the location, notify people of their presence upon arrival)
* Otherwise, advise not to buy for every guests and ask everybody to bring their own fuel. Only plan a bit more beers than what you as organizers need to incentivize people to donate.
* Don’t bring food for everyone, usually ended up being wasted, crêpes are an exception.
* No BBQ! In most public outdoor places in NL, fire is prohibited, could get you a LOT of trouble.

Funding:
* RULE 1: NEVER SELL ANYTHING, ULTRA ILLEGAL
* RULE 2: DO NOT ADVERTISE EVENT PUBLICLY
* Best: donations through [Tikkie](https://www.tikkie.me/)
    * Tikkie is most widely used with Dutch people (do not use French solutions if international crowd)
    * Tikkie allows printing QR code in advance; which you can put all over the party
    * Tikkie allows to set a minimum, but user can change the amount.
* Do not forget to have a cash box for people who do not have battery / tikkie
* Advertise Tikkie in advance on the event (send with the party info)
* Incentivize people to donate by reminding everyone upon arrival that they can do so through the printed QR codes / cash box.



## 1. The soundsystem

*Note: this section will be strongly biased since I only ever tested 2 brands:
RCF and Thomann TI box.*

In this section we will go over the basics of:

* what speakers to buy and why?
* what cables to buy and how to wire everything together?

### 1.1 What speakers to buy and why?

A soundsystem is usually defined by its watt consumption, since it basically correlates one to one as how loud it will get. So each component of a soundsystem will be chosen for its power usage (measured in kW) and its specific range of frequencies it reproduces. By that I mean that a typical soundsystem comprises 2 types of speakers: 2 or more regular loudspeakers which produces frequencies from 50 Hz to 24,000Hz (the entire audible spectrum by the human ear), and 1 or more subwoofers which focuses on the range 50 to 100 Hz, for the bass.

TODO: insert a graph of the frequency spectrum to explain low / mid / highs

Why have different speakers for different frequency bands? Well because the membrane size and overall speaker shape changes depending on which frequency you want to reproduce. Having a subwoofer in addition to regular speakers often allows the lower end of the spectrum to stand out, and allow the loudspeakers to spend more energy on the mid and high ends.

TODO: insert graph showing typical 2.1 setup

When raving outside, for a group of approximately 50 people, what you need is a system of a little more than 1 kW RMS. It's not crucial to have a subwoofer, depending on how good your speakers are. My current setup is the following:

* 2 x [RCF 315A loudspeakers]() (~300 euros each) at 400W RMS each, peaking at 800W.
* (optional) 1 x [RCF 705-AS II subwoofer](https://www.thomann.de/gb/rcf_sub_705_as_ii.htm) (~1000 euros) at 700W RMS, peaking at 1.4 kW.

I find the RCF loudspeakers to be of exceptionally clear quality, with an extremely flat response. What this means is that across all the frequencies between 50Hz to 24,000Hz, none are either attenuated nor boosted. Low quality speakers often artifically boost the lower ends, since people tend to get tricked into thinking a speaker is good when it sounds fat. Believe me you don't want that. A flat response is easier to work with as a DJ, you then have all the freedom to boost the bass yourself on the mixer equalizer (EQ), instead of having to tune your EQ to the actual speaker. Bad quality speakers also tend to screw up the very high ends, and will hurt the ears of your audience on loud hats. But this pair of RCF... I actually use them as monitoring at home, that's how good they are, while still being loud enough to throw a fucking party. Final note on the loudspeakers, it is crucial to have them on tripod stands so they are at head height, otherwise the sound will die out after only a couple layers of dancers.

Then, when I have enough power, I sometimes add the subwoofer. It's really cherry on the cake at this stage, but also pretty cool to have when leaning towards bass heavy electronic music (like hardcore, acidcore, dnb, etc.). I chose this specific subwoofer because it's the most compact and portable 15 inch woofer on the market, and because RCF fucking kills. Contrary to loudspeakers, you do not need a stand for your subwoofer, as low frequencies travel much further and are less impacted by human mass. Subwoofer is most of times the element of your soundsystem that will pump the most power (>1kW), so make sure you can afford it beforehand.

I would again really like to emphasize that if your wallet or power supply does not allow, don't think the party will be ruined from the lack thereof. I organized multiple parties with only a pair of RCF and it kicked ass each time.

## 1.2 What cables to buy and how to wire everything together?



## 2. DJ'ing: what setup?

Oh boi that's a tricky one. Also quite polarizing. So first of all, just so
you peepz know what camp I am in, fuck Pioneer and their expensive, heavy, cumbersome bullshit. Now that this is out of the way, in this section I will describe:
* the most portable setup (€)
* the club-like setup (€€€)
* the don'ts

### 2.1 The most portable setup

The most compact and feature-rich setup is having a controler like the [Native Instrument S4 MKIII](https://www.thomann.de/gb/native_instruments_traktor_s4_mk3.htm) paired with a MacBook Pro running Traktor Pro 3.

This controler is by far the best cash to value on the market, being 780 euros for a 4-channel controller, with a mixer, and controls for filter and effects that will remind you of the DJM 800. It's packed with amazing features, and the best beginner setup ever. You can plug the master output directly
the output of the S4 to the soundsystem.

There is a couple downsides to such a portable setup:
* **reliance on Traktor Pro**: in my experience, random crashes are not unlikely, and they have ruined some of my sets in the past.
* **judgemental DJs**: posers will tell you that controlers are for kids and won't play them because of that. I like to call them DJ Gatekeeper, usually makes them uncomfortable.

### 2.2 The club-like setup

The club-like setup will address the issues above, but come at the cost of being way more expensive, a lot heavier to carry, more cables to keep track of, larger table required, etc. I would only advise it if you start inviting DJ who mostly play vinyl or really ask you to have CDJs (since they are most comfortable with them).

The club-like setup is 3 parts:
* the external mixer
* the digital audio format players (CDJ)
* (optional) the analog audio format players (vinyl turntables)

Having an external mixer avoids the reliance on software like when using the internal miwer of the controler of the NI S4. It avoids putting all the pressure on your soundcard: having a lot of different sound sources (both analog and digital) while playing loud can lead to problems like quiet output, skips, lags and freezes.

I have tested three mixers in my life, they all worked out fine, and I have no
personal preference, but if I had to buy one again I'd probably buy the Xone 92
just because it is the industry standard:

* [Allen & Heath Xone DB2](https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xonedb2/): a 4-channels digital mixer with a soundcard which allows to use controllers like the [Traktor Kontrol X1](https://www.native-instruments.com/fr/products/traktor/dj-controllers/traktor-kontrol-x1/). It is quite compact compared to the two listed below, which is useful given the space restriction.
* [Allen & Heath Xone 92](https://www.allen-heath.com/ahproducts/xone92/): the workhorse of many clubs, 6-channels analogue mixer. Heavy, warm and reliable beast.
* [Pioneer DJM 800](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/506083-REG/Pioneer_DJM_800_DJM800_Four_Channel.html): 4-channels digital mixer which quickly became the reference

For the digital audio format player, I have two options:
* 2 x [XDJ-1000MK2](https://www.bax-shop.nl/tabletop-cd-mediaspeler/pioneer-xdj-1000mk2-digitale-tabletop): they are basically the CDJ Nexus 2000 without the CD player. The big plus is that they will avoid the reliance on an external soundcard and on a laptop. However, they are incredibly expensive for what they are, 1300 euro each. Only recommended if you already have a friend who can let them to you, or if you plan on offering the most streamlined setup to your DJs, since it will for sure be what most DJ expect and know how to play.
* 2 x [Traktor Kontrol X1](https://www.native-instruments.com/fr/products/traktor/dj-controllers/traktor-kontrol-x1/): cheap and feature-rich controllers for the Traktor Pro software. They rely on an external soundcard and on a laptop, so not ideal, but offer a much more affordable alternative than the XDJs.

For the vinyl turntables, I use 2 x technics SL1210 MKII for the vinyl players. I bought mine off this exceptional dude, [studio 4 holland](http://www.studio4holland.nl/), who basically refurbishes old technics parts and sell them just as new. I am so happy about everything, he even changed the LED color on one so I can recognize left from right, and took time to pair them so the pitch faders are synced. It will be 600 euros each, but worth every penny and guaranteed to work.

## 3. The power supply

Spoiler alert: **this is the part you don't want to fuck up**.

Here is a crash course in electrical engineering:

* power is measured in W
* the total Watt consumption of your system is the addition of the Watt consumption of its parts.

Easy right?

Now a little more complicated. Most manufacturers will state 2 figures for the
power consumption: the Watt RMS and the Watt peak. RMS stands for Root Mean Squared, which essentially means the average consumption of the equipment across time. So the RMS figure is the most important one, because it's the one you can expect the equipment to consume most of the time. Now, the instantaneous power usage will always be different from the RMS, and sometimes will be higher. The peak Watt figure indicated how high it could go, in the worst case scenario.

So how do you use these 2 figures? Well dimension your power supply with respect
to the RMS figures, but leave some room to account for the peak. To give an example, let's say I have the system described above: 2 x RCF315A at 300W RMS / 600W peak and 1 x RCF 705A at 700W RMS / 1,400W peak. You effectively need a power supply of 2 x 300 + 1 x 700 = 1,900W. However, due to the high peak count of each equipment, I leave a 30% security margin, which roughly accounts for 600W (0.3 * 1,900 = 570). So I would go for a generator of at least 2.5kW. Since in the end I will have to also power all the DJ equipment, I will go for something closer to 3.5 kW.

So here are the things you will need to size up to the power usage of the system:

* the generator(s)
* the extension cords and power sockets

### 3.1 The generator(s)

There are 2 features you are looking for in your generator: its power suppy **capacity** and if it's **surge protected**. The capacity should ideally be 20-30% above the total RMS power consumption of your system to account for peaks. The surge protection is a protection against voltage surges. Most of your equipment expects (in Europe) 230V. A gas-powered generator will do its best to provide a stable 230V, but it can fluctuate. Surge protected generator basically put a cap on how high that fluctuation could go. It is very important, because a voltage surge could mean burning sensitive gear. I recently had a mate burning a CDJ due to a voltage surge, believe me losing 1200 euros worth of equipment because of that is a traumatizing experience (also, fuck you Pioneer for selling your MP3 players for the price of a fucking motorbike).

The generator I so far have not bought, and only rented. The reason I do so is because, as everything mechanical, I expect a lot of maintenance, so I prefer renting so I am guaranteed to have a working engine. I may be wrong though, so if you feel like buying it, go ahead. I am based in the Netherlands, so I can only recommend Dutch retailers. If you happen to live in the Netherlands, I highly recommend boels for renting. [Their 2kW generator](https://www.boels.nl/en/hire/power-lighting/generators/electricity-generator-2-kva) is surge protected, very silent and does not consume too much gasoline. They also provide the gasoline.

### 3.2 Extension cords and power sockets

First things first, you absolutely need an extension cord, and a long one.
A generator does not only generate power, it also generates a fuckton of noise.
Go for a 25 meters extension roll, so you are able to distance the generator
from your party.

Now, if you are outside, I would recommend to get extension cords and power
sockets which are both surge protected and waterproof. In all cases, you should
consider having a tarp where all the electrical gear can sit without fear of it
getting burried in mud.

For the number of power sockets: aim high. Some artist live setups take 5 to 6
power sockets alone. I have bought a couple of [12 x power sockets](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/logon-lps030-10ac-uitgang-230v-1-5m-zwart-grijs-overspanningsbeveiliging/9200000076576523). Again, try
to get them surge protected and waterproof.

Think of distributing the power across your extension cords, i.e. do not put
both speakers AND subwoofer on a single extension cord. The best is to pull two
extenstion cords from you generator(s) so you can split the load in two. The
way I usually split is the following:

* 1 extension cord for the speakers, the DJ gear and lights.
* 1 extension cord for the subwoofer, the VJ gear.
