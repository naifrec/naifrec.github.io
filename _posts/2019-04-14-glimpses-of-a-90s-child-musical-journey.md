… and how it slowly drifted into the realms of ambient music

I listened to a lot of music when I was a kid, going through the eclectic discography of my mother. It is soothing to recollect these moments, how different my young ear was, without any prior knowledge or social constructs to alter my feelings about a track. As an only child, I lived this discovery as a secret and intimate journey through the different soundscapes the world had to offer. I had no words to describe the colors, shapes and hues of these pieces. So liking them meant gathering a pool of raw emotions which had to be consumed physically: singing phonetic English, dancing, crying, shivering, playing on repeat while gazing at the fields behind my backyard…

Among all the records I went through, the one that will stick forever is *Animals* by Pink Floyd (1976). My mother used to play it for me on my way to school. She knew some of the lyrics of Dog and she would teach me so I could sing along. Yet it is only years later I grasped the depth of this allegorical essay, sonic translation of the *Animal Farm* by George Orwell. So at the time I liked the track because it **sounded cool**, because it was novel to me to take 17 minutes to lay out a track with many different parts. To take the time to pause and bubble through space for minutes on end so the guitar and lyrics could come back with even more power and cascade down to the grand finale hammered through efficient syntactic and riffing repetition.

Needless to say the eight year old me kept asking for more, lucky me the year was 2001 and was released a compilation of Pink Floyd remastered tracks, featuring (among many others) *Echoes* (1971) and *Shine On You Crazy Diamond* (1975). These two tracks were originally separated in parts and spread out across the albums they appeared on, serving as introduction and conclusion. So purists blamed the album for being untrue to the original releases when these tracks each appeared remastered and stitched together into one single part. But I could not care less. I literally spent my Wednesday afternoons listening to them. The earlier work of Pink Floyd was more psychedelic, relied more fiercely on the synths and esoteric parts of Wright. He could mix together 18 minutes of pure bliss, creating a time sink, a singularity in the space time continuum where minutes become hours until the end of the track awakes you from the limbo and leaves you adrift, wondering where time went.

But music percolates from many other sources than listening directly to physical albums. People tend to remember soundtracks of movies, I remember the soundtrack of my childhood… video games. My father gave me my first PlayStation 1 as a Christmas gift, when I was only not even 5… Even as a kid I understood he wanted this console more than I did ahah. He had bought it with *[Crash Bandicoot](https://youtu.be/-lFwchGSkes)* and *[Gran Turismo](https://youtu.be/T-QJxdB4_U4)*. I played the latter a lot, I can still remember all of the manufacturer soundtracks, especially Honda. I would stare at the NSX special car for hours with the music below in the background, hoping I’d one day farm enough money to buy it.

When my parents divorced in 1998, my mother moved back to her parent’s in Normandy. I am an only child, so in order for me not to feel too alone, she arranged so my cousin Pierre would spend almost all of his week-ends with me at my grandparents’ house. We were almost 2 years apart, him being my cadet, and he quickly became the brother I never had. We spent so much time together, playing, or just watching each other play. We would wake up at 6am and go downstairs on the tip of our toes not to be spotted by my grandfather to get to the room where the console was. It is impossible to cite all the games we played, but some of the most vivid memories I have are on *Crash Bandicoot 3*, *Crash Bash*, *Crash Team Racing* (the only true kart racing game, change my mind), *Gran Turismo 1* and *2*, *Spyro the Dragon*, *MDK*, *Syphon Filter*, *Tekken 3*, and so many more…

I was lucky enough to grow up as the fifth generation of console came out, more specifically the PlayStation (and its successors) which had the specificity of having a CD-ROM player, making it de facto the console of choice for music lovers. In [this interview](https://youtu.be/6Kc2gGycBXc) of Stewart Copeland, the former drummer of the Police, about his composition work on Spyro the Dragon game (1998), the genius himself says:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
“The Sony PlayStation has room for high-quality music, it has full bandwidth, it’s the same you get with a CD. Whereas the other platforms have very thin bandwidths. And the thinness of the bandwidth puts an imposition on the composer, where he has to create sounds that will fit within that. On these CD-ROM games there is so much space, I don’t have to worry, I can let a full symphonic sounds there […] in this game I’ve got whole orchestra sounds that I recorded in Utah.”

Yet, the video game scene did not only attract composers from the general public scene. A lot of the video games at the end of the 90’s had fast-paced, techno oriented soundtracks, heavily influenced by the then vibrant raving scene. One of the most obvious examples is the [soundtrack of *Wip3out*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE8333C6A8D37F371) (1999) featuring the likes of Sasha and the Chemical Brothers, or the title track of *Ghost in the Shell* (1997) produced by Takkyu Ishino himself (some Japanese version of Jeff Mills [when it comes to mixing](https://youtu.be/-hKUhdh_zqE)). I even realized I made my first encounter with acid techno while playing *Colin McRae 2* (2000) when I was eight and did not even know Roland existed… Just listen to [that crazy 303 line](https://youtu.be/mIRluy2OHys) for fuck’s sake!… These two genres stayed rampant in my brain and creeped into me so much that, 15 years later, my friends and I created a social digging group on Facebook to scout for acid techno bombs in the depths of the Internet: [all we need is acid](https://www.facebook.com/groups/allweneedisacid).

As I delved into the OST’s of the video games across all gens of the PlayStation I realized I could go on forever… So to remain concise I made a playlist gathering all the not-so-hidden gems I found during this nostalgia trip, ordered by video game release year. Be sure to check it out, it contains anything from hip-hop to rock with bits of neo-classical and of course some more techno / jungle induced sweetness.

Anyway! Going back to ambient, I think my first true encounter with the genre was through the second edition of Spyro: Spyro Gateway to Glimmer (or Ripto’s Rage in the US, 1999). The three hub worlds had music very akin to Brian Eno’s Thursday Afternoon, simple and efficient layering of far away synths cleverly capturing summer, autumn and winter feels. I have to say tears filled my eyes as I was listening to them and reading the comments of all these people reminiscing the past, writing (cheesy) comments like this one:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 25px">
I still have my original PlayStation that I played when I was 2. This game was the first video game I ever played in my entire life and even as a baby i would at least make it through all the worlds and collect the Talismans. So luckily for me, I can still go back and play this game which I actually just got done doing a couple of hours ago. It never gets old. I don’t think there’s a greater sadness than the ones we’re enduring now, the realization that we will never be kids again. This is a bearable sadness however because we want to feel the faint happiness that comes as a side effect. Just think, our generation has this soundtrack unique to us and no one else. Only we can find ourselves yearning for the old days. We come together now and fill the atmosphere with happiness and positivity. Nothing will ever beat the 90s and early 2000s. I love you all.

I now realize what made me love ambient as much as I do now. Sorry Brian Eno, but this is where it began.

As I grew older, my father gave me the responsibility to digitize his music collection. His collection was vastly different from my mother’s. While still very eclectic, his was more leaning towards jazz and blues music. He bought the big iPod classic and a station so we could play music while he was cooking. Those were special times for us. As the years, places and girlfriends passed, the “music while cooking” times stayed. From the many names coming back to my head I would cite *[Thelonious Monk](https://youtu.be/F1ALT0vuS9M)*, *[Fats Waller](https://youtu.be/o6eKURTn3Ws)*, *[John Lee Hooker](https://youtu.be/yzmogN7aj-I)* but also and more surprisingly *Saint Germain*’s infamous Tourist album.

One day in 2008 he came back from a trip to Paris where he had enjoyed both Buddha Bar and Hotel Costes music. By that time I had taught him how to download music, and the student had soon surpassed the teacher. He basically ripped the whole discography and fit it on his iPod. I remember smoking a cigar with him on a warm summer night listening to the [11th Hotel Costes compilation](https://youtu.be/Jky3ZZg1PKM). He would tell me to remember these moments of bonding.. and they did crystallize in my mind. He was happy he could share them with me, taking revenge of the absence of such moments with his own father. When I think of these times, this next track comes with them.

While lounge music does get us closer to ambient, we are not quite there yet. Closing the loop is an artist that my mother and father had in common: Moby. His (best) albums *18* and *Play* played so many times throughout my childhood. I remember listening to *[One of These Mornings](https://youtu.be/hqxbSggZ-vI)* on repeat, picturing an imaginary scene of my mother leaving my father in my head. The first part of *Play* was also very moving to me. It is funny how we all have that masochistic trait of playing music which unearth our deepest sorrows, just to contemplate our despair and cry. In fact it has to be a coping mechanism, yet another channel to express feelings which cannot merely be captured by words or thoughts.

While most of the sonic discoveries I described so far were through a third party, either a relative, a movie or a video game, I did search around for some music for myself. Yet, it only happened relatively late (circa 2008), almost like I had to go through a burn-in period to digest the different genres presented to me and find my place. A more down to earth explanation is that 2008 corresponds to [the true beginning of YouTube as a music platform](https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2017/06/01/the-long-slow-decline-of-bittorrent/), following the explosion of P2P file sharing in 2006. Music was not only free, it was easy to reach.

Unsurprisingly, the first genre I started digging was hip-hop. It sits right at the boundaries of all the genres I presented above: electronic for the beats, jazz and rock for the looped samples, while preserving the importance of the lyrics. It is also the genre I identified to the most. It was the only genre that was “mine”. Nobody helped me discover it, I discovered it in my video games. I had been blaring West Coast hip-hop through [Radio Los Santos](https://youtu.be/XcBTcGf8pU0?t=308) for the past 4 years, and it had that rebellious hook to it… “how can you listen to this, Guillaume?”

While hip-hop is all about being gangsta and shit, the nerd in me applied the scientific method to the genre’s discovery, following carefully the same process for each artist: look for their wiki page, check all their albums, listen to all of them chronologically, never read reviews to come unbiased. The duo Guru/Premiere, also known as Gang Starr, was the first to undergo this meticulous process. I remembered them from *[Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4](https://youtu.be/h8J7A9BjcEE)* (2002), and wanted to hear more. Their second album, *Step in the Arena* (1991) is my favorite. DJ Premiere was godlike, putting out many classic East Coast instrumentals like in *[Who’s Gonna Take the Weight](https://youtu.be/WeoCOdbAy3s)*. But he also knew how to “step aside” to leave room for Guru’s flow to engage you more directly like in *[Precisely the Right Rhymes](https://youtu.be/1KBj15nw1kE)*.
