...rethinking and re-appropriating the idea of a men's right movement

The title of this article is probably very irritating to many, as the idea of men's right movement is associated to wildly mysoginistic groups, like men going their own way, the red pill, 4chan, or other websites from the manosphere. The wikipedia page of men's right movement quickly shows that men forming groups to think about feminism has seemingly always ended up in staunch antifeminist movements, even when the original intention was to help the cause, from cishet male activists on the left of the political spectrum whose partners were active feminists themselves. So the idea of reviving the idea or, more accurately reappropriating the idea of a men's right movement may sound stupid from the get go, but please allow me to explain.

Increasingly over the years, I have started to consume more and more feminist content. It started with Instagram, where the French "scene" (if you can call it that) saw a massive surge of activism in the wake of 2018, with accounts like ["t'as joui"](https://www.instagram.com/tasjoui/) (did you cum?) blew up and even caught the attention of traditional media. This wave distilled many feminist messages, first focusing on the female orgasm, but more and more accounts being created and specialized to many subcauses. For instance the beautiful work of [Bordel de MÃ¨res](https://www.instagram.com/bordel.de.meres/) (by the amazing [Fionna Schmidt](https://www.instagram.com/fiona.n.schmidt/)) challenges the view that a woman should always want or look forward to being a mother. More recent work like [la charge raciale](https://www.instagram.com/la.charge.raciale/) shows the vastly absent (from French media at least) perspective of asian people in France, and the layered complexity of the stigma of being adopted, as can be seen in [her letter to her (adoptive) parents](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAhtQsYgV4u/).

The ideas took a long time to grow on me, yet daily exposure to feminist theory helped to crystalize its essence. After 2 years, I started to look around for more activist content. I turned to the media and website I spent most of my time on, YouTube. Funnily enough, it did bring a vastly different perspective; as most channels I started following are US-based, in stark contrast with the accounts I am following on Instagram (mostly French). While there is a lot of overlap in the topics, channels from so-called breadtube like [ContraPoints](https://www.youtube.com/c/ContraPoints/), [hbomberguy](https://www.youtube.com/user/hbomberguy), [Patricia Taxxon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjLfFE0TABS9bk05oH-kgw) or [T1J](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCajw8zd6DPpXOuF6d22Fjkw) did strike me as different for two reasons: (1) they were my first "first-hand" experience of trans(feminist) activism (contra and patricia) and (2) they were the first to show me the "other side", the conservative YouTube, the "Red Pill". Not to say that in France such ideology does not exist, it clearly does, and more perniciously so as your average French dude thinks feminism is solved - which I would argue is worse than thinking it is a problem (like red pillers) since it's basically the same position minus the self awareness.
