  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Today I am taking a break from the series commemorating point blank, first because these articles are pretty demanding, but also because I am getting a bit overwhelmed by them feels. I guess it’s my own lil’ paradox, I always feel nostalgic yet each time I dig into the past, be it through photos or something else, I end up with tears in my eyes and without being able to continue? Germans probably have a word for this ahah.</p>

<p>I may not know the German word; but I just stumbled upon a track on my video game playlist which does have some of this longing for a foregone past feel. Fighting Force is a game I have played so many times from start to finish with my cousin. You could pick from 4 characters, I would always go for Smasher the big muscular guy; and Pierre would get Hawk; the other dude. This game jived with us because it felt to us like a more complete street fight mode for Tekken; another game we loved, I think Tekken 2 was actually my first game… well I should say my father’s first game but we know how it went already ahah. In Fighting Force; one could use the environment to their advantage; it was destructible, something rare at the time. Destroy a car, pick up a metal bar from the wreckage and smash the incoming wave of enemies with it. Pick up a shotgun and blast through a couple enemies before running out of ammo and throwing the gun in their face. By today standards the game play probably feels rigid af, but yea; was pretty exciting for its time! And unique too!</p>

<p>I was happy to rediscover this game’s soundtrack last year, realizing it was very beautifully produced. Composed by <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/5479-Martin-Iveson">Martin Iveson</a>, the tracks are mostly breaked goodness, often including an electric guitar as main instrument, which is somewhat rare for the genre; although pretty common for video game music I reckon. Some tracks do it better than others, <a href="https://youtu.be/a-vdh6Pj5FU">Boss 2</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/FMrcnWdJP-E">Zeng</a> are pretty cool ones, but the true highlights for me are Hideout and Credits, let’s take them one by one.</p>

    Fighting Force - Hideout (1997)
</div>

<p>This track stands out from the soundtrack, the guitar solo is very melancholic, and the background breaks / bass music somehow works really well with it. It paints a gracefully desolated moment, although I am unsure when it is played in the game, it brings back the memory of one part where you are on an elevator, fighting your way through a military base, and one can see the beautiful city in the background through the glass shaft, sunset in the background.</p>

    Fighting Force - Credits (1997)
</div>

<p>The last track, played during credits, is a special one. The bassline hits just right, an echoey acoustic guitar plays from time to time, floating. The super arcadey sounding synth coming near 00:30 truly sends me Japanese vibes, further confirmed by the piano coming later in the track. Sign of the future? This game was published by Eidos Interactive… also known as… <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Square_Enix_Europe">Square Enix Europe</a> since 2009, the European branch of the legendary Japanese development company! Eidos Interactive and Core Design; the developers, probably rings a bell to some, as they are better known for developing the Tomb Raider entries on PlayStation 1; the one that made the series the legend it is today, although I have never liked this genre myself.</p>
